<1:1 1:1  God (a-4)  Heb. Elohim, the plural of Eloah, 'the Supreme'. It is  Deity in the absolute sense. Elohim will, in the text, appear  only in the name of Jehovah Elohim; moreover, when Elohim  following immediately on Jehovah has a grammatical adjunct,  its place will be taken by the English word 'God'. see Gen.  9.26 and 24.7. Other Hebrew divine names translated as 'God'  will be indicated as follows. Eloah +God; El, (meaning 'The  Mighty,' see Gen. 14.18), *God. For the meaning of Jehovah,  (Heb. Yahveh, or Yehveh), the ever-existing One, see Ex.  3.14,15; Isa. 40.28. For Jah, the existing One objectively,  see Ex. 15.2; Ps. 68.4. The name seems to express absolute  rather than continuous existence. For Adonai (a name of  God, not merely a title), translated 'Lord', see Ezek. 2.4.>

<2:5 2:5  mingled (k-18)  It cannot, I think, be doubted that this is more than, and  intended to be more than 'anointed.' 'Mixed,' 'mingled,' is the  sense of the word. In Ps. 92.10 it is not merely 'anointed' as  consecration, but his whole system is invigorated and  strengthened by it. It formed his strength; hence it is 'fresh  oil' there.>

<4:15 4:15  one (a-20)  The expression 'one shall slaughter' has interest in respect  of the point where self-offering and mediatorial work begins.

<5:6 5:6  trespass-offering (f-6) The Hebrew word for trespass is derived from a verb translated, 'be guilty,' ver. 2 and elsewhere.
  atonement (g-35)  Here is seen the use of 'atonement,' Heb. kaphar, to cover.  It is a thing done for men towards God. It is not  'sprinkling,' 'washing,' nor exactly 'propitiation,' though  that be nearer; but there was guilt on the man, a moral  offensiveness which had to be removed out of God's sight. So it  was in the offering. It was really bringing his trespass to God  in the offering, but in the way of a given atonement for it, by  entering into it as his. In ver. 7 it is lit. 'he shall bring  his trespass [offering] which he hath sinned.' For the  burnt-offering, which was also to make atonement [kaphar],  see ch. 1.4.>

<119:11 119:11  *word (k-2)  It may be well to notice the distinction between Dabar and  Imrah, so frequent in this Psalm. Dabar is 'word,' agreeing  with Logos in the New Testament; Omer and Imrah mean 'a  word,' 'speech,' 'what is said,' and, if we except Josh. 24.27,  are only used in poetic style. The latter form (Imrah), which  is feminine, alone occurs here; 'saying' might have done for  it, were it not otherwise objectionable. It fixes the mind more  especially on what is expressed, having thus occasionally the  force of 'promise' (Omer), as Ps. 77.8, or 'command'  (Imrah), as Ps. 147.15. In the sense of 'word' Imrah is  found twenty-six times, of which nineteen are in this Psalm,  where it is distinguished from Dabar by a dot (*) placed  before 'word.' A modified form, also in the sense of 'word,' is  found in Lam. 2.17.>

<1:17 1:17  away (a-18)  In those days conquerors transported conquered nations to  distant seats, and replaced them by others, that national  feeling might not subsist, but dependence be complete.  'Carrying away' is feeble for this, but I know no other word.>
<1:18 1:18  is, (b-13)  The Greek expression here translated 'that is' emphasizes the  peculiar manner of the birth.>
<1:19 1:19  unwilling (c-10)  The expression is characteristic. 'being a man not willing,'  &c.>
<1:20 1:20  Lord (d-13)  'Lord' without the article, signifying, as often, 'Jehovah.'>
<1:21 1:21  Jesus, (e-14)  See Note, Ex. 17.9.>
<1:22 1:22  Lord, (d-17)  'Lord' without the article, signifying, as often, 'Jehovah.'
  through (a-18)  'Through' here is dia. The difference is always made  between the source, God, for which hupo is used, and the  instruments, for which dia is employed. 'By' in this verse is  hupo.

<2:1 2:1  born (d-5)  Lit. 'begotten,' but used for 'born.' In ver. 2 it is the  fact of being brought forth -- of course strictly of the  mother. It was the actual fact of his being born or brought  forth that the magi refer to.>

  that (c-11)  'That that might be,' ch. 1.22; 'so that that should be,' as  here; and, 'then was fulfilled,' ver. 17, are never confounded  in the quotations of the Old Testament. The first is the object  of the prophecy; the second, not simply its object, but an  event which was within the scope and intention of the prophecy;  the third is merely a case in point, where what happened was an  illustration of what was said in the prophecy.>
<2:20 2:20  sought (b-21)  Lit. the seekers of.' The article and participle are used as  a noun, characterizing the persons.>
<2:23 2:23  through (a-19)  Dia. see ch. 1.22; Jer 31.15.
  that (c-11)  'That that might be,' ch. 1.22; 'so that that should be,' as  here; and, 'then was fulfilled,' ver. 17, are never confounded  in the quotations of the Old Testament.

<3:8 3:8  Produce (i-1)  The verb is in the aorist. It is to be the characteristic of  the man, not a mere exhortation for the future. 'Be in the  state of having done it.'
  repentance. (k-6)  The word here and elsewhere translated 'repentance' denotes  the moral judgment of the soul upon all the past, upon all that  it is in the flesh before God. It includes, but goes further  than, a change of mind.>
<3:10 3:10  to (l-7)  I so translate, because 'laid to' implies actual execution.  perhaps not meant so by the translators, but merely to be as  literal as possible. but 'applied to' ('to,' pros. see ch. 21.1)  is more the moral way of acting -- something more than  'set for' ('for,' eis) as in Luke 2.34; Phil.1.16; 1Thess.3.3.
  producing (a-17)  Present tense; it is characteristic. see ch. 1.19.>
<3:11 3:11  sandals (b-20)  The luxurious 'shoe' is not meant here.
  with (c-31)  En, 'in the power of,' be it external or simply the nature  and character of, but always including the latter. see Luke 2.27.>
<3:14 3:14  forbad (d-4)  Imperfect, 'was so doing.' i.e. the act is presented as being  then done, not historically presented as one past fact.
  baptised (e-12)  Aorist tense, 'to be in the state of its having been done.'  see ch. 3.8.>

<4:9 4:9  homage. (l-19)  Proskuneo. an act of personal reverence and homage. What in  modern language is called 'worship' is Latreuo, as 'serve,'  ver. 10. The nearest to this in the use of proskuneo is John 4.23,24.>
<4:10 4:10  homage (l-17)  Proskuneo. an act of personal reverence and homage. What in  modern language is called 'worship' is Latreuo, as 'serve,'  ver. 10. The nearest to this in the use of proskuneo is John 4.23,24.

<4:11 4:11  ministered (n-11)  Diakoneo, as ch. 27.55; and 'serve,' ch. 20.28.>
<4:13 4:13  sea-side (o-15)  The Lake of Tiberias. see John 6.1.>
<4:14 4:14  saying, (a-13)  Isa. 9.1,2.>
<4:20 4:20  trawl-nets, (b-6)  Lit. 'the trawl-nets.' The word is supposed to derive from  the verb 'to cast.' so Mark 1.18; Luke 5.2-6; John 21.6-11;  'seine,' in Matt. 13.47, is a net drawn round from the shore.>
<4:21 4:21  the (c-20)  It is well to notice here an habitual use of the article. It is a known  rule that contrast, and hence one part of a thing as  contradistinguished from another, has the article. This is the case  with 'ship' and 'mountain' in the gospels. 'he was' or 'went'  'on board ship;' not a particular ship, but 'on board  ship,' as we say, in contrast with 'on shore.' So 'the  mountain;' not a particular mountain, but in contrast with the  plain, where the plain and the mountain are in contrast. Christ  had a particular ship which waited on him, but the article is  used, as here, where that is not the case. 'In the ship with'  is tantamount to 'the same ship;' so here I do not change the  form, but translate literally.>
<4:24 4:24  pains, (d-25)  'Torments,' or 'tortures.'>
<4:25 4:25  Decapolis, (e-9)  Meaning, 'ten towns' -- a district with ten towns in NE.  Palestine.>
<5:1 5:1  the (c-9)  It is well to notice here an habitual use of the article. It  is a known rule that contrast, and hence one part of a thing as  contradistinguished from another, has the article. This is the  case with 'ship' and 'mountain' in the gospels. 'he was' or  'went' 'on board ship;' not a particular ship, but 'on board  ship,' as we say, in contrast with 'on shore.' So 'the  mountain;' not a particular mountain, but in contrast with the  plain, where the plain and the mountain are in contrast. Christ  had a particular ship which waited on him, but the article is  used, as here, where that is not the case. 'In the ship with'  is tantamount to 'the same ship;' so here I do not change the  form, but translate literally.>
<5:5 5:5  earth. (f-9)  Or 'land.' This is a quotation from Ps. 37.11. For a Jew,  inheriting the land was inheriting the earth, and vice versa.  It was not the haughty Pharisee or the violent who were to have  it. God would give it to the meek of the earth that waited on  Him. I have put 'earth' as giving a larger thought, as  characteristic, not local only. Here ge in Greek, agrees with  erets, in Hebrew. See Notes, 1Sam. 2.8; Ps. 2.8.>
<5:13 5:13  earth; (a-7)  Or 'land.'>
<5:15 5:15  bushel, (b-12)  I have left 'bushel' as well known; it was a measure under  half a bushel.>
<5:16 5:16  upright (c-14)  I do not put 'good works,' because it has acquired the force  of benevolent actions, which is not the force here, but all  that is upright and honourable and comely, what ought to be in  one who feels aright. 'Upright' does not quite give the whole  sense. see 'good work,' Mark 14.6; Titus 2.14.>
<5:17 5:17  fulfil. (d-24)  'Give the fulness of.' It is not to fulfil a command in the  way of obedience, nor to complete another thing by adding to  it; but to fill up some system sketched out, or that which is  expressed in the thing fulfilled, as a whole. Thus the doctrine  of the Church completed the word of God, made full what was  expressed by it. Christ does not here fulfil what is said, nor  add to what still remained and was perfect itself; but came to  make good the whole scope of law and prophets. The passage has  nothing to do with obeying the law. Nor is it here  accomplishing a particular prophecy. He comes as the revealed  completeness of God's mind, whatever the law and the prophets  had pointed out. Verse 18 forbids the sense of obedience as not  to be maintained, though 19 proves that he was to be condemned  who, being under law, broke the commandments spoken of. But  this is a consequence; Christ speaks of their authority. All  was to be fulfilled in some way or another, not set aside.>
<5:20 5:20  surpass (e-10)  Or 'excel.' It includes the idea of being a better  righteousness. see ver. 47.>
<5:22 5:22  Raca, (f-29)  i.e. stupid, worthless, a term of contempt.
  Fool, (g-43)  As chs. 23.17; 25.2,3,8.
  to (h-47)  Eis. has the force of 'even to,' 'as far as,'as in other  cases. as Rom. 5.21, 'to eternal life;' Rev. 13.3, 'to death;'  Eph. 3.19, 'to all the fulness.'
  hell (i-52)  Gehenna. so vers. 29,30.>
<5:25 5:25  time (a-18)  Or 'lest it may be.' Perhaps 'lest' is sufficient; it  suggests something uncertain which otherwise might happen any  time. see Mark 4.12.>
<5:26 5:26  farthing. (b-20)  The quarter of an assarion. see ch. 10.29.>
<5:29 5:29  snare (c-8)  Lit. the 'catch of a trap.' see ch. 13.57.>
<5:37 5:37  evil. (d-18)  Or 'the evil one.'>
<6:1 6:1  alms (a-7)  Many read, probably rightly, 'your righteousness.'>
<6:2 6:2  have (b-37) 'Have' has here the force of having all they have to expect -- they have the whole of it already. It is expressed in English by laying the stress on 'have.' Perhaps one might say 'have got.'>
<6:5 6:5  have (b-41) 'Have' has here the force of having all they have to expect -- they have the whole of it already. It is expressed in English by laying the stress on 'have.' Perhaps one might say 'have got.'>
<6:8 6:8  beg (c-19)  Aiteo. see ch. 7.7.>
<6:11 6:11  bread, (d-6)  Or 'our bread till to-morrow,' i.e. 'daily' in the sense of  'till to-morrow.' What was directly and immediately for them or  their need, and not to surround them with abundance.>
<6:13 6:13  evil. (e-11)  Or 'the evil one.'>
<6:16 6:16  have (b-32)  'Have' has here the force of having all they have to expect  -- they have the whole of it already. It is expressed in  English by laying the stress on 'have.' Perhaps one might say  'have got.'>
<6:24 6:24  serve (f-4)  serve (f-32)
  Douleuo, serve as a slave.>
<6:27 6:27  growth (a-11)  The proper sense is 'age.' It refers to relative age in man,  and hence is used for 'growth,' or 'stature,' as Luke 19.3.>
<7:6 7:6  lest (b-17)  See ch. 5.25 and Mark 4.12.>
<7:7 7:7  Ask (c-1)  Aiteo, used for supplication. see Note, John 14.16.>
<7:14 7:14  narrow (d-2)  Or 'how narrow.'>
<7:16 7:16  know (a-6) 'Recognize,' 'know well,' as in ch. 11.27.>
<7:20 7:20  know (a-8)  'Recognize,' 'know well,' as in ch. 11.27.
  surely (b-5)  i.e. as a necessary consequence.>
<7:24 7:24  who (c-18)  Hostis, as ch. 2.6. Of that character. 'who was such as.'
  the (d-23)  Here the article has the force of contrast, as in ch. 4.21.  As in English, though the cases are more rare, we say, 'on the  way,' 'the way side.' 'The sand' in ver. 26, contrasts with  'the rock' -- that which has that nature.>
<8:3 8:3  touched (e-8)  As Mark 1.41.>
<8:4 8:4  for (f-25)  Eis. as ch. 12.20, 'unto.'>
<8:5 8:5  entered (g-5)  Many authorities read, 'as he entered.'>
<8:8 8:8  word, (h-23)  Lit. 'with' or 'by a word,' in contrast with coming.>
<8:17 8:17  through (a-10)  See Note, ch. 1.22.
  saying, (b-14)  Isa. 53.4.>
<8:26 8:26  was (c-27)  Ginomai. Lit. 'it then began' or 'took place.'>
<8:28 8:28  Gergesenes, (d-17)  Some read 'Gadarenes,' others 'Gerasenes.'>
<8:29 8:29  us? (e-26)  Or, perhaps, 'to torment us before the time.'>
<8:34 8:34  to (f-19)  Or, more exactly, 'they begged him, so that he might go  away.' see a similar expression in ch. 9.38.>
<9:1 9:1  city. (a-15)  i.e. Capernaum, ch. 4.13, and Mark 2.1.>
<9:6 9:6  power (b-12)  Exousia, 'right,' 'authority.' see Note, ch. 10.1 and John  10.18.>
<9:8 9:8  power (b-15)  Exousia, 'right,' 'authority.' see Note, ch. 10.1 and John  10.18.>
<9:13 9:13  is (c-7)  See Hos. 6.6.>
<9:16 9:16  new (d-8)  Lit. 'unfulled,' 'unmilled.'>
<9:18 9:18  this (e-22)  Mark 5.23 has 'is at extremity;' Luke 8.42 'was dying.' It is  possible that Matthew may give the result of the servant's  message. It may be translated 'has just now died,' or 'has even  now died.' see Rev. 2.8.>
<9:31 9:31  name (a-10)  Or 'fame' -- translated in ch. 28.15 'is current' and in Mark  1.45 'spread abroad.'>
<9:34 9:34  through (b-10)  En, 'in the power of,'>
<9:38 9:38  that (c-8)  See Note, ch. 8.34.>
<10:1 10:1  power (d-12)  Or 'authority.' exousia not dunamis. More than authority,  but not simply dunamis; it is more than dunamis, as it  includes the right to exercise this. Hence 'power' is nearer to  it in English. dunamis is the ability to do a thing. Cf. Luke  4.36.>
<10:4 10:4  Cananaean, (e-3)  Very probably the Hebrew word for the Greek term Zelotes,  'Zealot.' see Luke 6.15.>
<10:5 10:5  [the] (f-16)  [the] (f-19)
  Absence of the article in the original gives the force of  'any.'>
<10:12 10:12  into (a-5)  Lit. 'the.' it hardly alludes to the house in ver. 11, for  ver. 13 seems to preclude this. It is going into the house, in  contrast with the street.>
<10:17 10:17  sanhedrims, (b-12)  Local Jewish tribunals.>
<10:21 10:21  death; (c-24)  Or 'bring about their death.' See Note at Mark 13.12.>
<10:24 10:24  the (d-1)  the (d-9)
  There is no article in the original, but 'disciple' and  'bondman' come after the verb and are characteristic.>
<10:25 10:25  called (e-23)  The word suggests the giving of a surname or nickname.>
<10:27 10:27  houses. (f-22)  i.e. upon the terraced roofs.>
<10:28 10:28  of (g-5)  Here, and in the parallel passage, Luke 12.4, we have apo,  'from.' It is not so used elsewhere that I know of in the New  Testament. Here it may have the force of 'shrinking from  through fear.'
  hell. (h-30)  Gehenna.>
<10:29 10:29  farthing? (i-8)  Lit. assarion. the value of an assarion is not exactly  known. it was very small.>
<11:3 11:3  wait (a-14)  Probably, 'have we to do it,' not simply, 'are we doing it?'>
<11:10 11:10  written, (b-8)  Mal. 3.1.>
<11:11 11:11  one (c-28)  Or 'the least.' It is the comparative degree; whoever else is  taken, the 'one' is less; the idiomatic force is more preserved  by 'a little one.'>
<11:12 11:12  violence, (d-19)  As 'forces his way,' Luke 16.16.>
<11:14 11:14  is (e-11)  By saying, 'who is to come,' it is left in the abstract as in  Greek -- the one who had this character in their mind.>
<11:19 11:19  wine-drinking, (a-20)  'Spending his substance in eating and drinking.'>
<11:20 11:20  place, (b-18)  Ginomai, 'taken place,' or 'happened.' I do not say 'had  been wrought,' because the emphasis is on the place of their  happening rather than on the fact of their being wrought.>
<11:21 11:21  place (b-18)  Ginomai, 'taken place,' or 'happened.' I do not say 'had  been wrought,' because the emphasis is on the place of their  happening rather than on the fact of their being wrought.>
<11:23 11:23  hades. (c-17)  'Hades' like 'Sheol' in the Old Testament, see Note at Ps.  6.5, is a very vague expression used in general to designate  the temporary state of departed spirits, the unseen or  invisible world of spirits, upon which, till the coming of  Christ, darkness and obscurity rested, as may be seen in the  Old Testament. It is applied to Christ, who went into paradise,  and to the rich man in Luke 16, who found himself in torment.  It is distinct from 'Gehenna,' the place of final and eternal  torment, prepared for the devil and his angels.>
<11:27 11:27  knows (d-14)  know (d-24)
  Epiginosko, as ch. 7.16. It is real knowledge, not a mere  objective acquaintance with a person.>
<12:7 12:7  is. (e-7)  See ch. 9.13.>
<12:9 12:9  away (f-3)  The Greek always implies a change of place -- leaving one and  going to another, as chs. 15.29; 17.20, 'transported.'>
<12:15 12:15  knowing (a-3)  Ginosko, ver. 15, objective knowledge. In ver. 25 it is  Oida, conscious knowledge. See Note, 1Cor. 8.1.>
<12:17 12:17  saying, (b-13)  Isa. 42.1-4.>
<12:20 12:20  forth (c-18)  The word is the same here as 'brings forth,' ver. 35, and  'brings out,' ch. 13.52. It signifies 'putting forth' as much  as 'bringing forth.' It means that judgment was hid, and 'shut  up among his treasures' (see Deut. 32.34), and in due time it  will be produced, without saying he brings it with him, or  sends it without coming. It is brought out and displayed in its  time.
  unto (d-20)  Eis. it directs the mind to the point to be reached.>

  abundance; (b-17)  As to the good thing given. It is abstract; the object is not  to day what is given, but the manner of God's dealing. What  is given is caused to be in abundance. We may say, also, 'he  shall be in abundance,' a word used of the thing and of the  person possessing it>
<13:14 13:14  in (c-2)  i.e. what is wanting is supplied and so 'filled up.' Since  Esaias's time there had been much of this, but the rejection of  Christ completed and filled it up. 'In them' has therefore the  sense of 'as to,' 'in their case.' 'By' would cast more on  their act and responsibility. epi seems to have been  introduced to avoid this sense of it.

<13:57 13:57  offended (c-4)  Or 'were stumbled at him,' but the word 'stumbled' is too  weak. The root word in Greek, skandalon, is literally 'the  catch of a trap,' that makes it fall when touched. It is  generally the occasion, or means, of getting into an evil case,  not a stumbling-stone. See chs. 5.29; 18.6.>
<14:2 14:2  these (d-21)  Lit. 'the.' see ch. 15.12.
  him. (e-29)  As nearly as possible 'operate in him.' The passage has a  certain reflexive force as in French, s'operent par lui. I  have sought to preserve this by adding 'their force.' the  difficulty partly arises from the word which is used for the  effects of power, being the plural of power itself, because the  power which wrought is more seen than the effects. 'Powers' and  'miracles' are the same in Greek. Hence it may be translated,  'these powers operate in him;' but its reflexive force is, I  doubt not, the true one. For the sense, however, I should not  object to 'display themselves in him.'>

<14:23 14:23  mountain (c-11)  Here, as noticed already, 'the mountain' is in contrast with  the plain, so of 'the ship.' It is not 'a mountain,' but he  left the low ground by the sea and went up. see Note, ch. 4.21.>

<15:26 15:26  dogs. (k-21)  'A little dog,' more slighting than 'dog' in Greek; but  'little dog' is rather the contrary in English. I would not say  'cur,' fearing it might be too strong, but I have no doubt of  the greater contempt expressed by the word; also in ver. 27.>
<15:27 15:27  Yea, (l-4)  Or else we may say 'Yet' here, as admitting the truth, but  pleading; nai is used for affirming what is said, but also  for beseeching, as, indeed, in English we say, 'Yes, do it.'  'Yet' seems perhaps to express this more clearly, as the  admission of what Christ said is thus evident; the 'but' is  wanting if we say 'yea.' The Authorized Version avoids the  difficulty discussed by all the critics by translating freely,  but the 'for even' of the original is lost. 'Yet' thus used  gives assent and obsecration, and this seems the force of  nai. See Rev. 22.20, 'Amen; come.' If we say 'Truth, Lord,'  we must add 'yet.' 'Truth, Lord, [yet hear] for even.' As to  nai having this tacitly beseeching character, see Philemon  20, and so it is taken by many. Otherwise nai contradicts the  Lord, who had said ouk, and kai gar follows naturally. And  I suspect this to be the better sense. 'Yes, Lord, you may do  it, for even.' so I have put it in the text.>

<16:6 16:6  beware (d-8)  The Greek means, 'to fix one's mind on;' and the 'of' is  'because of,' 'in view of.' 'To attend so as to guard yourself  from.' 'Beware of,' I believe, most nearly conveys it. so ver.  11.>

<6:20 6:20  safe; (b-17)  Or 'observed him diligently.' The word has the force of  'watching closely, and keeping in mind,' whether to pay  attention to, or to preserve. Which of these applications is  the just one is the question. It is used four times (three  besides this); twice for 'preserved,' as the wine and the  bottles, Matt. 9.17; Luke 5.38; once for Mary's 'keeping'  things in her heart, Luke 2.19. I should have preferred  'observed him diligently,' but that I do not find it used of a person,  meaning 'paying attention to what he says.' It is used  of words and opinions, but then it has still the force of  'keeping them safe.'>

<6:1 6:1  second-first (d-8)  The expression 'second-first sabbath' is explained thus. The  year, as regards the worship of God amongst the Jews, began  with the month Abib (Heb. 'green corn'), which lasted from the  middle of March to the middle of April. In Leviticus 23, in  which we find the Jewish feasts described, we may observe that  in addition to the general and weekly recurring feasts of the  sabbath, the chief feasts begin with the passover (the 14th of  Abib), and that, in immediate connexion with it, it was  ordained that on the day after the following sabbath the  first-fruits of the corn should be offered in the ear, a  foreshadowing of the resurrection of Jesus which took place on  the morrow after the sabbath of the passover week, or feast of  unleavened bread. The sabbath immediately following the  passover was therefore the 'first' or great sabbath, and after  the offering of the first-fruits on the morrow after the  sabbath, the first day of the week, the harvest might be  commenced, and the new corn eaten, which was not permitted  before, even though corn stood ripe in the fields. On the  following sabbath, the 'second' after the 'first' or great  sabbath, we see that the disciples ate ears of corn on the way,  for the offering of the first-fruits had already taken place on  the first day of the week; and, as seven weeks or sabbaths were  counted from this day to the feast of Pentecost, it was  therefore the 'first' of these seven sabbaths, or the 'second'  with reference to the great sabbath of the Passover.>

<1:2 1:2  He (c-1)  In John, the personal pronoun, generally emphatic in Greek  where inserted, is used so constantly that it can hardly be  considered such in many cases, but certain instances which are  considered to be more definitely emphatic are given in italics.  The same spirit of emphasis causes the very frequent use of  ekeinos for the third person ('he,' 'they,' &c.). Its sense  is 'that,' contrasted with 'this,' and hence is emphatic; as  'that man' in English, sometimes having the sense of 'such a  one as that.' A number of cases where this word also is used  emphatically have also been indicated.>

  with (d-22)  para,  with a genitive as here, means 'on the part of;'  'from with' gives the sense. But this must not be understood in  the sense of 'with' merely. It has not this significance in the  New Testament.>
<1:17 1:17  subsists (e-11)  Ginomai, 'has come,' that which, not having actually been  in being before (i.e. in the world), now begins to be so. So  the Word was (v. 1), but everything else 'began to be.' The  world 'had its being,' 'began to be,' through Him (v. 10). He  'became flesh' (v. 14), ginomai. So 'grace and truth came  into being.' I am not satisfied with 'subsists,' but 'came'  gives the idea of coming into the world. No doubt they did so,  but the word has not this force. They began to exist de facto  down here. The verb is singular, and 'grace and truth' go  together in the person of Christ. Nothing subsisted by the law,  it was a rule given; but grace and truth actually commenced to  be, not in God's mind of course, but in revelation and actual  existence down here. But its so taking place supposes its  continuance.>

  so (b-3)  I have hesitated a moment whether 'so' referred to the kind  of love that gives 'eternal life,' which is mentioned in verse  15, and is the great subject of John, in contrast with all  earthly blessings and favour. The sense then would thus be,  that he has loved men in view of eternal life, 'so that' he has  given, &c. (See 'so,' Acts 14. 1.) When followed by 'that,' the  regular force of the Greek is, 'so much that.'

<14:16 14:16  beg (a-4)  In the latter chapters of John's Gospel, in order to maintain  the distinction, frequently important, between erotao and  aiteo, the first is translated 'demand' [except John 14.16  (beg)], the second 'ask.' There are times when they may be used  indiscriminately, at other times each has a sense peculiar to  itself. erotao expressing a familiar request to a person  where intimacy exists [or equality, either assumed or actual];  aiteo, the request rather for something by an inferior to his  superior. The disciples employ both of these words in their  relations with Jesus, but only aiteo with relation to the  Father. In his relations with his Father, Jesus employs  erotao but not aiteo. Martha uses aiteo in ch. 11.22. For  the difference between the two, compare John 16.23. In ch.  14.16 the word is erotao; in vers. 13 and 14 aiteo.

  This passage (vers. 15-17) illustrates the force of two Greek  words for 'to love,' phileo and agapao. The former  signifies the love of friendship, and is more intimate and  intense. It is here translated 'I am attached to,' and in ch.  16.27 'have affection for.' Agapao, more often used in the  New Testament, is more general, and signifies love as the  settled disposition of a person rather than as an emotion. It  is used for God's love to man (except in Titus 3.4, where a  compound word is used which embodies the word phileo) and for  the love of men to God. Both words are used for the love of the  Father for the Son, phileo once only, John 5.20, and agapao  in John 3.35, &c.. and for the love of Christ for his own,  phileo in John 11.3 and agapao in John 11.5 and elsewhere.  Phileo is used in John 16.27, of the love of the Father for  the disciples, and of the love of the disciples for Christ.>

No one can be  called upon really but God, so that the word has great force as  used here. I have said 'praying' for want of a better word.>

<13:20 13:20  about (e-17)  Where the computation begins is not stated. The judges were  given after the land's being given by lot, and that order of  things reached up to Samuel, to four hundred and fifty years,  whenever that four hundred and fifty years began. It might be  at the Exodus, and very probably so. But it is not that there  were judges during all that time. Indeed, they were only raised  up occasionally. I have no difficulty myself as to the  chronology, notwithstanding the dicta of some. The main blunder  of their computations lies in this. they have taken Eli and  Samson as distinct periods from the Philistine oppression,  whereas it is perfectly clear the Philistine oppression  included both. We have to go on to Mizpeh for the close.>

  mercies (f-26)  'Mercies' and 'gracious one' (Hosios) are the same word,  only singular and plural. It may, and sometimes does, mean  'holy,' but is not the regular word for it, which is Hagios.  here it answers to chasid in Hebrew, which is contrasted in  Ps. 89.19 with 'holy' (kadosh), which is applied to Jehovah  (ver. 18). The beginning of the psalm speaks of the mercies  (chasadim) or gracious ways of the Lord, and then in ver. 19  of that One in whom these graces or mercies are centred and  conveyed, the Christ, to whom the apostle here applies it. The  word chesed is generally 'grace' and 'loving-kindness' in  God; chasid, 'pious,' 'gracious' applied to men, and  'merciful,' 'holy' to God. see Heb. 7.26.>

  own. (c-35)  I am fully satisfied that this is the right translation of  ver. 28. To make it a question of the divinity of Christ (which  I hold to be of the foundation of Christianity) is absurd. It  has been questioned whether 'of his own' can be used thus  absolutely in the singular. But we have it in John 15.19, and  in the neuter singular for material things, Acts 4.32.

<1:1 1:1  called (f-7)  'A called apostle,' i.e. an apostle by (divine) calling. Cf.  ver. 7 'called saints,' and see note there.>
<1:2 1:2  writings,) (g-11)  'In holy writings.' there is no article in the original. The  statement of the apostle is general, addressing himself, as he  does, to Gentiles.>
<1:4 1:4  Spirit (h-11)  In many cases it is impossible to put a small or a large S  rightly to the word Spirit, as the presence and power of the  Holy Spirit characterizes the state, and that and the state are  both included; so it is here. It is divine, not merely human,  perfectness, and by the Holy Spirit, yet it is Christ's state.  But it is not merely a state, but that state which consists in  the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, and is the absolute  expression of it. On the whole, I put a large S here, but it is  the Son manifested on earth who is spoken of, and  characteristic of him. Resurrection was the proof, but he who  had eyes to see, saw what came in flesh justified in the Spirit  even when here, the same Spirit which was quickening power in  resurrection, as 1Pet. 3.18.
  holiness, (i-13)  Hagiosune, the nature and quality itself, as 2Cor. 7.1 and 1Thess. 3.13.  Distinct from hagiasmos, the practical effect  produced, the character in activity, translated 'holiness' in  Rom. 6.19,22; 1Cor. 1.30; 1Tim. 2.15; Heb. 12.14; and  'sanctification' in 1Thess. 4.3; 4.7; 2Thess. 2.13 and 1Pet. 1.2.  Another word, hagiotes, is used in Heb. 12.10 (the only  time in Scripture), for the quality itself.
  dead) (k-18)  Plural, 'of dead persons.'>
<1:6 1:6  called (a-7)  'Called ones of Jesus Christ' is what they are.>
<1:7 1:7  called (b-10)  'Called saints' is ambiguous in English, but the sense is  that they are saints by the calling of God. The Greek implies  that they are already saints, not called to be so.>
<1:10 1:10  prospered (c-15)  This does not refer to a prosperous journey, but to the hope  that God may favour or prosper him so that he may come; he had  long wished it, and hoped that at last it might be granted him.>
<1:17 1:17  God (d-4)  'Righteousness of God.' The absence of the article may arrest  the mind here, and in some other places, in this part of the  epistle. It is likely to do so, because the righteousness of  God is now a known doctrine; not so when the apostle taught.  The righteousness of God was a wholly new thought, as was  indeed wrath from heaven. wrath on earth was not. The gospel,  or 'glad tidings,' was the power of God to salvation, because  righteousness of God (that kind of righteousness) was revealed  -- not a righteousness required of man. See ch. 3.21.  by (e-25)  'By faith.' The word 'by' is the same in Greek (ek) as that  translated 'on the principle of.' I have left 'by' as being a  quotation from Hab. 2.4.>
<1:18 1:18  heaven (f-9)  'Wrath of God from heaven is revealed.' see Note d; 'there'  is merely the impersonal form, not an adverb, but necessary, as  it is difficult to put the words in another order without  injuring the sense.>
<1:19 1:19  is (g-3)  Or 'may be.' The Greek word here is used for 'may be known.'  What is spoken of here is 'knowledge acquirable by nature in  contrast with revelation,' it means what is within the capacity  of man's apprehension. But 'is known' sufficiently represents  that and is more exact.>
<1:20 1:20  divinity, (h-30)  What is characteristic of God; not 'Godhead,' as in Col. 2.9.
  render (i-35)  The Greek expression does not affirm that they are so, but  states the consequence of the display of creative glory in  what was seen. 'So that they should,' or 'might be,' is  ambiguous in English, and implies purpose. Hence I have said  'so as to render,' which gives the sense.>
<1:21 1:21  Because (a-1)  This is the second reason. the first is ver. 19.
  thoughts, (b-19)  The 'inward reasonings of the mind,' as Luke 9.46. The word  'thoughts' in English conveys this best.>
<1:25 1:25  who (c-1)  The word implies the character. 'who were such as,' see Matt.  7.24.>
<1:28 1:28  good (d-8)  Not 'did not like.' The word means 'to assay, test, prove,'  and thence 'to approve' as Phil. 1.10.
  reprobate (e-21)  Or, as some, 'a mind void of moral discernment.'>
<1:30 1:30  God, (f-4)  I doubt that it has the sense of 'God-haters.' It acquired  the sense of 'abominably wicked.' as 'cursed children' does not  mean that a curse is pronounced, but that they are fit only to  be so named. It is the moral state.>
<1:32 1:32  who (g-1)  As in v. 25, 'who being such as so knew.'
  judgment (h-5)  Dikaioma. what the righteous will of God requires; hence  even an ordinance of his will, or a righteous act meeting his  requirement. See ch. 5.18; Luke 1.6; and Rev. 15.4, where it is  judgment itself. In ch. 2.5, 'righteous judgment' is  dikaiokrisia.
  do (i-11)  Prasso. to do an act. see John 5.29.
  practise (k-20)  Poieo. practise a course of action. see John 5.29.
  delight (l-25)  It means that not only their own passions carry them away,  but, being thoroughly corrupt, they enjoy other people's  sinning, associating themselves in thought and spirit with  them, as taking pleasure in their doing so.>
<2:1 2:1  condemnest (m-20)  A play on words in Greek, strengthening the sense. The words  for 'judgment' and 'condemnest' are from the same root.>
<2:7 2:7  works, (a-9)  Lit. 'good work,' singular.
  incorruptibility, (b-16)  Not 'immortality;' the resurrection, or change, of the body  is looked for; and it is thus a part of Christian truth. see 2Tim. 1.10.>

<2:27 2:27  with (i-11)  Dia. The expression has the sense of 'in a given state or  condition,' as well as 'by means of.' Their having or  possessing the letter of the law and circumcision practically  puts the Jews in that condition.>

<3:5 3:5  wrath? (c-17)  'Inflicts wrath' is hardly English, as wrath is a sentiment  of the mind; and it is what reaches another which is inflicted,  as punishment or pain. But 'executes' is not the sense, nor is  'takes vengeance.' The form of expression in Greek, as in the  use of 'inflict' in English, is a figure of the effect for the  cause, so I have ventured to use it.>

<3:25 3:25  mercy-seat, (q-7)  I do not think this word can be used for '[a] propitiatory  [sacrifice]' or 'propitiation;' it certainly is not the  habitual use in the LXX; and we have the two parts of the work  of the great day of atonement, here and in ch. 4.25; 'set  forth,' here, has a reflexive force; see Note e, Heb. 1.3.
  by (a-25)  'In respect of the passing by the sins.' I have hesitated as  to using dia with the accusative in this sense here; but on  the whole I do not doubt it gives the sense. God had passed by,  not brought into judgment, the sins of Old Testament believers;  and the accomplishment of the atonement showed His  righteousness in this. Now the righteousness is itself shown,  and to be relied on.>
<4:3 4:3  say? (b-6)  See Gen. 15.6.
  as (c-17)  I am not quite satisfied with 'as;' but it is the nearest  approach to the sense in English. 'For,' I object to; because  then faith is made of positive worth, having the value of  righteousness; whereas the sense is that he was holden for  righteous in virtue of faith. 'For' does not go far enough as  righteousness; too far as to a positive value of faith. Faith  might be reckoned for righteousness, and yet the righteousness  come short of what was required; whereas if it be reckoned as  righteousness, then the full value of righteousness, as such,  is seen. 'the man was held to have righteousness.' It is a  Hebrew form. See Ps. 106.31. Gen. 15.6, where there is no  preposition, makes the force of the expression plain.>

<4:12 4:12  Abraham. (a-31)  'Father of circumcision' means, he in whom real separation to  God was first publicly established. Perhaps 'of the faith,  during [his] uncircumcision, of our father Abraham' may be  clearer.>

<4:20 4:20  faith, (f-15)  'Found strength in faith' may be rather free, but  'strengthened by faith' might very easily be applied to his  body, whereas it means that he was inwardly strengthened by  faith. It is, I apprehend, in opposition to 'hesitating through  unbelief.' Literally, it is 'gifted with strength.' Abraham was  gifted with strength by faith (i.e. inwardly, in contrast with  doubt).>

<4:25 4:25  justification, (h-14)  See Note k, ch. 5.16.>
<5:2 5:2  have (i-4)  Perfect tense. 'have obtained and possess.'>
<5:6 5:6  died (k-13)  Or 'died.' so ver. 8. The aorist; but 'has died' is used in  English for the fact, which is the force of the aorist. That  is, it is so used where the moral import is an abiding one, and  time is not in question, even if no abiding effect is meant.  'He has taken a journey.' The simple preterite, 'died,' is not  an aorist in English; it is historical, and the fact is viewed  as past and done with.>
<5:9 5:9  of] (a-11)  Or 'by his blood,' 'by his life.' when en is used morally  it has the force of 'in the power of,' 'in the intrinsic  character of;' thus 'in flesh,' 'in spirit.' The article and  pronoun here give it a somewhat more instrumental character.  'Through' in ver. 10 is dia.>
<5:10 5:10  of] (a-29)  Or 'by his blood,' 'by his life.' when en is used morally  it has the force of 'in the power of,' 'in the intrinsic  character of;' thus 'in flesh,' 'in spirit.' The article and  pronoun here give it a somewhat more instrumental character.  'Through' in ver. 10 is dia.>
<5:12 5:12   (b-0)  The epistle divides itself here, as to doctrine, into two  distinct parts, which a new paragraph hardly shows. Up to ch.  5.11 'sins' had been treated of; from this point 'sin' is in  view.>
<5:13 5:13  account (c-15)  This is a different word from that translated 'reckoned' in  ch. 4.22,23 (both 'imputed' in A.V.). There, a man is  judicially estimated such or such. here, a particular fault is  put to a person's account. The former is found in Gal. 3.6 and 2Cor. 5.19; this only in Philem. 18.>
<5:14 5:14  reigned (d-3)  Or 'has reigned,' aorist.
  in (e-15)  Or 'according to.' 'Sinned after' is not the sense here. It  refers to Hos. 6.7, 'They, like Adam, have transgressed the  covenant.' this of Israel. But they who had no law did not. The  point here is the form or character in or with which anything  happens; that which gives it its character.>
<5:15 5:15  offence? (f-11)  Or 'not as the offence [is] the act of favour.'
  one (g-18)  Lit. 'the one.'>
<5:16 5:16  gift? (h-12)  Or 'And not as by one that sinned [is] the gift.' I would add  that I have translated the Greek words, dorema as 'gift,'  charisma as 'act of favour,' and dorea as 'free gift.' This  will distinguish them.
  of (i-17)  That is, had its foundation in, was grounded on, one single  thing or act.
  justification. (k-30)  Dikaioma; or 'judicial righteousness.' Here the Greek is  more exact than English perhaps allows. It is the state of  accomplished subsisting righteousness before God, in which  justification places us. The word dikaiosis, 'justification,'  in ver. 18 and ch. 4.25 is the act of justifying. In English we  must use justification for both. I cannot say 'righteousness;'  that might be practical. In ch. 4.25 the doing of it was in  view, 'for our justifying;' not, as some read, 'because we are  justified,' which could only be said in connection with faith,  whereas 'for our justifying' is the effect future to the rising  again.>
<5:17 5:17  Christ.) (l-38)  Vers. 13-17 are a parenthesis.>
<5:18 5:18  righteousness (m-17)  Here dikaioma; the same word as translated 'justification,'  ver. 16, but it cannot be so translated here. It is the  accomplished subsisting righteousness answering to the one  offence.>
<5:20 5:20  in, (a-4)  Came in as an extra thing, or by the by.>
<5:21 5:21  righteousness (b-20)  i.e. on that principle of righteousness, dikaiosune. i.e.  the quality itself, as ch. 3.21.>
<6:5 6:5  with (c-7)  Lit. 'grown up with' and so thoroughly one. cf. Luke 8.7. It  is not 'planted together with.'>

  serve (e-25)  i.e. serve as bondmen.>
<6:7 6:7  justified (f-7)  'Free' is ambiguous. It is justified, cleared, discharged.  From sin, note, not sins.>
<6:9 6:9  knowing (d-1) In ver. 6 it is objective knowledge, ginosko. In vers. 9  and 16 it is conscious knowledge, oida. See Note to 1Cor. 8.1.>
<6:10 6:10  died, (g-6)  died (g-9)
  Or 'he died,' aorist. It is the fact. see Note, ch. 5.6.>
<6:13 6:13  yield (h-2)  There is a distinction between the present tense, which has a  continuous present sense, and the aorist, which gives the act  in itself. 'Neither yield your members,' ver. 13 (present  tense), means that it is at no time to be done. 'Yield  yourselves to God' and 'yield your members,' ver. 15 (aorists),  mean let it have been done, as a once accomplished act.
  dead, (i-20)  Lit. 'as out of dead alive.' The order of the words gives a  contrasted force. not merely that they came thence. But 'out of  dead alive' is hardly English.>
<6:15 6:15  sin (k-5)  Or 'are we to sin?' the subjunctive aorist.>
<6:16 6:16  Know (d-1)  In ver. 6 it is objective knowledge, ginosko. In vers. 9  and 16 it is conscious knowledge, oida. See Note to 1Cor. 8.1.>

<7:14 7:14  know (m-3)  Oida. as ch. 6.16.

<8:3 8:3  sin, (d-30)  i.e. as a sacrifice for sin. The same expression as in Heb.  10.6,18,26; 13.11. Used frequently in LXX in Leviticus for a  'sin-offering,' as Lev. 5.11; 7.37; 16.5; Num. 8.8.>
<8:4 8:4  requirement (e-6)  'Righteous requirement,' as ch. 1.32; not the 'habit of  righteousness.'>
<8:9 8:9  Spirit, (f-9)  An instance of the difficulty of putting a large or small  'S.' It is clearly the state and characteristic of the  believer; but it is so by the presence of the Spirit. See ver.  15; ch. 1.4.>
<8:15 8:15  adoption, (g-20)  'A spirit of adoption' might read 'Spirit of adoption.' See  Notes on ver. 9 and ch 1.4. 'Adoption' is the same word as  'sonship' in Gal. 4.5.>
<8:17 8:17  with (a-25)  Lit. 'If we co-suffer that we may be co-glorified,' but this  is hardly English.>
<8:18 8:18  revealed (b-23)  Or 'the glory about to be revealed.' but the sense is most  nearly given in the text. See Gal. 3.23 and 1Cor. 3.22. The  emphasis is on 'coming,' in contrast with 'this present time.'>
<8:19 8:19  anxious (c-3)  Or 'constant,' as Phil. 1.20.>
<8:21 8:21  glory (d-20)  'Glorious liberty,' as in A.V., does not give the sense. The  creature has no part in the liberty of grace; but it will have  in that which glory gives.>
<8:22 8:22  creation (e-7)  'Creation' is the same in Greek as 'creature' in vers. 19-21;  but the Greek for 'whole' gives it a concrete and not an  abstract character, i.e. 'creation.'>

  adoption, (g-23)  See Note, ver. 15.>
<8:26 8:26  help (h-10)  It means 'to take up a person's cause, so as to help him.'  The 'with,' added in Greek, is rendered 'join.' Only occurs  here and Luke 10.40.

<8:37 8:37  loved (a-14)  Aorist. See Note to ch. 5.6.>
<9:3 9:3  brethren, (b-16)  I apprehend, in the apostle's mind the phrase 'for my  brethren' is connected with both 'pain in my heart' and 'a  curse from Christ;' he parenthetically states how far his heart  had gone for Israel, and then continues the phrase. This want  of strict continuation of grammatical structure is very common  with the apostle from the ardour of his style, and only adds  force to what he says. He had loved them as much as Moses. (Ex. 32.32.)  His pain was continuous. but the wish, 'to be a curse,'  was like that of Moses, a moment's earnest appeal, as beside  himself.>
<9:4 9:4  adoption, (c-7)  As ch. 8.23.
  service, (d-19)  As latreuo. See Note l to Matt. 4.10.>
<9:5 9:5  all, (e-18)  'Who is over all' is emphatic. he exists and subsists as  such. It may be translated also 'is' or 'exists God over all.'>
<9:7 9:7  thee. (f-20)  See Gen. 21.12.>
<9:9 9:9  promise, (g-6)  See Gen. 18.10.
  Sarah. (h-21)  The apostle's object is, not to state what the word of  promise is, but that the word he quotes, on which all depended,  is a matter of promise.>

<9:32 9:32  of (f-13)  'As of works.' Ek, here translated 'of,' is translated 'on  the principle of' in chs. 1.17; 5.1; 9.32. But this sense is  clearer here in having simply 'of' after the 'as,' and the  sentence less encumbered.
  stumblingstone, (g-20)  Christ is the stumblingstone, as Paul goes on to explain.>
<9:33 9:33  written, (h-5)  See Isa. 8.14 and 28.16.>
<10:1 10:1  delight (i-3)  i.e. his good pleasure, the thought that delighted him. The  order of the words gives the force of 'own,' or an emphatic  'my.' The connection of the beginning of the phrase with  'for salvation' is not very grammatical; but this abruptness  of style is usual with Paul. See Note, ch. 9.3.
  them (k-17)  Some authorities have 'for Israel,' but 'for them' is the  more correct reading, and, occupied as the apostle is with his  subject, is far more beautiful. 'For salvation' is perhaps a  little obscure; but what he says is, what would satisfy his  heart was that; and his prayers tended that way, not to their  judgment, evil as they were, and rejecters of Christ. But the  judgment was not yet revealed.>

  through (n-17)  through (n-24)
  Epi, 'through,' signifies the occasion or condition under  which a thing happens, not the means of, as an instrument.  'through' expresses this more nearly than 'by.' See Note, ch.  5.14, 'in.'>

<11:21 11:21  either. (f-18)  This is another case where the grammatical structure is not  complete. It may well be taken, 'fear ... lest he spare not  thee;' the beginning of ver. 21 adding a supplementary thought,  of which the apostle's mind was full; still it is a broken  phrase.>
<11:22 11:22  abide (g-23)  The subjunctive, 'if thou shouldest abide,' or 'abidest.'  There are three degrees of condition in Greek. indicative, if  the fact arrives; subjunctive, doubtful if it will; and  conditional, of uncertain probability.>

<11:30 11:30  believed (d-9)  See Note q, ch. 10.21.>
<11:31 11:31  mercy. (e-20)  This means that the Jews would not believe in the mercy shown  to the Gentiles, and thus lost the glad tidings of the grace of  God for themselves; and thus, their right to the promises being  gone, they come in at the end as objects of mere mercy, as any  poor Gentile might be, though, by that mercy, God accomplishes  his promises, to which, as to their present responsibility,  they had lost all title. It is this which gives rise to the  apostle's expressions of admiration as to the wisdom of God.>

  laud (g-14)  'Praise' in this verse is the present tense, see Note h, ch.  6.13. 'Laud' is the aorist of the same verb, but with a  strengthening preposition prefixed, giving the sense of 'let  them have him lauded.'>
<15:12 15:12  says, (h-4)  See Isa. 11.10.>
<15:16 15:16  be (i-4)  This gives the sense most accurately; the object of the gift  was his being minister; 'for,' eis.
  minister (k-5)  An administrator officially employed. see Phil. 2.25; Heb.  1.7; 8.2. Leitourgos. as 'officers,' ch. 13.6.>

It is the subjunctive; i.e. not a fact  assumed to happen, though not yet come; nor treated as  improbable, though it may happen, but between the two -- the  possibility and intention expressed. The sentence does not  follow grammatically, but is interrupted by 'for I hope,' &c.

<15:27 15:27  indeed, (d-6)  It might be taken as a simple repetition of the beginning of  ver. 26.>
<16:1 16:1  minister (e-11)  Diakonos; deacon, or deaconess; the word 'minister' here  connects with 'to minister' and 'ministry' elsewhere, as ch. 15.31.  She did the needed service in the assembly there; she  was not properly a servant.>
<16:2 16:2  assist (f-16)  helper (f-32)
  'Assist' is 'to stand by her and help her.' 'Helper,'  prostatis, in this verse is stronger and has a higher sense,  and means 'helping as a patron. ' It was used for a Roman  patron, and is applied in special honour to Phoebe as one whose  help many had been dependent on and had profited by. It was a  complimentary touch of heart in which the apostle never fails.  they were to 'stand by her for assistance,' but she had  been 'a patron' in the matter.>
<16:4 16:4  staked (g-5)  Or 'risked,' 'hazarded.'>
<16:18 16:18  serve (a-3)  Douleuo. 'to serve as a bondman' as chs. 12.11; 14.18.

<16:19 16:19  reached (c-5)  i.e. 'come to the knowledge of.'>
<16:20 16:20  bruise (d-7)  As Luke 9.39, 'crushing;' Rev. 2.27; 'broken in pieces.'>
<16:25 16:25  mystery, (e-27)  It formed no part of what was unfolded in the ages of time,  in which God developed his plans in creation; it was a purpose  before, and eternally hidden; it was not in reckoned time. See 1Cor. 2.7-10; Eph. 3.2-11; 5.32; Col. 1.25-27; 2.2,3.>

<1:2 1:2  saints, (a-17)  Saints by [divine] calling.>
<1:4 1:4  of (b-10)  I am not quite satisfied with 'in respect of.' It is epi  with the dative, which has the force of 'the occasion of,' or  condition under which anything happens, not its cause.>
<1:5 1:5  word (c-12)  Logos, whatever is the expression of a thought formed in  the mind, and otherwise unknown; hence used for the thing  expressed, or the expression of it. hence 'word.' Here it is  the communication of the mind of God in the gospel of Christ.  (See ch. 2.1.) I retain 'word' in the expression 'all word, and  all knowledge,' adding 'of doctrine' in brackets, because 'in  all word' is scarcely English, and the 'word of doctrine' is, I  believe, the sense here. 'Utterance' gives the sense  imperfectly. It is the matter and form of thought and  expression, as well as the utterance of it. It is a word so  large in sense as to be very hard to express. Whatever  expresses the mind is logos. Nous (ch. 2.16, 'mind') is the  intelligent faculty. whatever expresses the thought formed in  it is logos. There is thus the intelligent and the  intelligible. Thus all that communicates the divine mind (the  intelligible) is logos, and first of all Christ himself. But  we are said, having the Holy Spirit, to have also the 'mind' of  Christ, the intelligent faculty with its thoughts (ch. 2.16).>

<1:21 1:21  world (d-9)  Kosmos, the usual word for world. see chs. 3.19; 6.2; Heb. 9.1.
  preaching (e-25)  'The preaching' gives a different sense from 'preaching.'  Without the article it is the instrument, the foolishness of  such a means. Here 'the preaching' is the actual thing  preached; and such is the force of the Greek.>
<1:23 1:23  offence, (f-9)  Lit. 'fall-trap,' as Matt. 13.57.>

<2:10 2:10  [his] (a-8)  Or 'the Spirit.'>
<2:11 2:11  man (b-11)  'Man' here has the article, but the sense is this. what is in  man's mind is not known of any but the spirit of the man  himself, who has the thoughts; much more is it so with God.>
<2:12 2:12  Spirit (c-13)  Note here again the difficulty, arising from 'spirit' used  for cause and state, as to putting a large S to signify the  person of the Holy Spirit.>
<2:13 2:13  wisdom, (d-11)  It may perhaps be translated, 'taught words of human wisdom.'
  communicating (e-19)  Or 'expounding.' it means literally 'mixing or putting  together;' as interpreting or expounding, it is common in the  LXX. Gen. 40.8; 41.12,15; 'determined,' Num. 15.34.>
<2:14 2:14  natural (f-3)  Psuchikos. the man animated merely by his created soul,  without the teaching and power of the Holy Spirit.>
<2:16 2:16  him? (g-13)  See Isa. 40.13-14.
  mind (h-18)  Nous, 'the intelligent faculty;' see Note, ch. 1.5.>
<3:1 3:1  fleshly; (i-18)  Sarkinos. as Rom. 7.14; Heb. 7.16; 2Cor. 3.3. This word is  said to mean properly the material -- the composition of a  thing. 'Carnal,' twice in verse 3, is sarkinos, a form used,  in some places, to express either material or physical or moral  ideas. It occurs also in Rom. 15.27; 1Cor. 9.11; 2Cor. 1.12; 10.4; 1Pet. 2.11.  This last passage, 'fleshly lusts,' shows how  the material and moral thoughts run into one another.>
<3:3 3:3  carnal. (i-5)  carnal, (i-18)
  Sarkinos. as Rom. 7.14; Heb. 7.16; 2Cor. 3.3. This word is  said to mean properly the material -- the composition of a  thing. 'Carnal,' twice in verse 3, is sarkinos, a form used,  in some places, to express either material or physical or moral  ideas. It occurs also in Rom. 15.27; 1Cor. 9.11; 2Cor. 1.12; 10.4; 1Pet. 2.11.  This last passage, 'fleshly lusts,' shows how  the material and moral thoughts run into one another.>
<3:5 3:5  servants, (k-9)  Diakonos. see Note, ch. 4.1; Rom. 16.1.>
<3:9 3:9  fellow-workmen; (l-5)  'Workers, or labourers together with God,' goes too far.  The Greek word has the sense of journeyman, but they are  fellows doing the chief's work. see 2Cor. 6.1.>
<3:13 3:13  it (a-16)  That is, the day. see 2Thess. 2.8.>
<3:15 3:15  fire. (b-24)  The addition of the article gives the right sense. 'saved by  fire' may mean that the fire was a means of safety, whereas  'through the fire' is in spite of it, or going through the  danger and difficulty of it. Dia has two distinct uses as  'through' in English. see 1Pet. 3.20 for the other sense.>
<3:16 3:16  temple (c-9)  Naos. the house itself -- the shrine.>
<3:17 3:17  temple (c-6)  temple (c-15)
  Naos. the house itself -- the shrine.
  corrupt (d-4)  destroy; (d-12)
  The word for 'destroy' and 'corrupt' is the same in Greek;  the force of this is lost in English. see Note d, Eph. 4.22.>
<3:18 3:18  deceive (e-4)  A strong word. See Note at 1Tim. 2.14.
  be (f-12)  Or 'has the appearance of being.'>
<3:19 3:19  written, (g-14)  See Job 5.13.>
<3:20 3:20  again, (h-2)  See Ps. 94.11.>
<4:1 4:1  servants (i-9)  The appointed servant. Three words are translated 'servant'.  doulos, a slave, bondman; diakonos, a person who acts or  waits in service; and huperetes, as here, which is always  used in the New Testament for an official servant, or  apparitor. see Luke 1.2; Acts 26.16. For latreuo, serve, see  Matt. 4.10.>
<4:3 4:3  examined (k-13)  The word does not signify 'judgment,' but the preliminary  examination, at which the accused has to answer and give an  account of himself, as Luke 23.14.>
<4:5 4:5  God. (l-43)  Lit. 'then shall the praise be to each from God.'>
<4:6 4:6  application, (m-10)  The word is used for a metaphor, no doubt, because a metaphor  transfers the thoughts as to one object, to another which is an  image of it. Amos says, 'The lion has roared,' speaking of  God's threatening ways with Israel, as if he were his prey. in  thought it is to be transferred to Israel. So here Paul is  really speaking of those who came with great pretensions  amongst the Corinthians, and he transferred it to himself and  Apollos, that he might establish the principle universally,  without naming these persons. By saying he 'transferred' it,  the application was easy. but one can hardly say that is a  figure.>
<4:13 4:13  insulted, (a-1)  Or 'spoken to injuriously.'
  entreat. (b-3)  Parakaleo. The word has to be rendered very differently in  English in different places, and is hard to render, though  simple and easy to understand. It means 'to call upon a person  so as to stimulate him to anything;' hence 'to exhort, comfort  or encourage.' see Note to 2Cor. 1.4. It has a fuller force  here than a mere apostolic or pastoral exhortation.
  world, (c-12)  Kosmos. as chs. 1.20; 7.31,34.>
<4:16 4:16  entreat (b-2)  Parakaleo. The word has to be rendered very differently in  English in different places, and is hard to render, though  simple and easy to understand. It means 'to call upon a person  so as to stimulate him to anything;' hence 'to exhort, comfort  or encourage.' see Note to 2Cor. 1.4. It has a fuller force  here than a mere apostolic or pastoral exhortation.>
<5:1 5:1  reported (d-4)  This does not quite give the sense. It was the reputation  they had by common report.>
<5:7 5:7  out (e-2)  See Note b, 2Tim. 2.21.>
<6:2 6:2   (a-0)  A question, with some expression of surprise, as 'is it so  that you do not?' previous circumstances leading one to suppose  they could not know. see Rom. 6.3; 7.1; 11.2. I have added  'then' to give the force in English. In Rom. 2.4 the force as  seen in 'or' is more apparent.
  judgments? (b-27)  'To judge the smallest matters?'>
<6:5 6:5  brethren! (c-30)  Lit. 'between his brother [and brother].'>
<6:11 6:11  washed, (d-12)  Or 'washed from' what defiled, so as to be clean. see Acts 22.16. Washed is strengthened by the addition of the  preposition 'from' (apo).
  in (e-23)  by (e-31)  En, 'in virtue of the power of.'>
<6:16 6:16  flesh. (a-24)  Lit. 'to (eis) one flesh.' In English 'shall' or 'shall  become' is the nearest in sense. It corresponds to the Hebrew  of Gen. 2.24. Eis is left out when he says 'one Spirit' in  ver. 17. We are really 'one Spirit,' not two, with the Lord.  But we cannot say, 'to' or 'for one flesh.' The two become so  (i.e. 'one flesh') practically by their union; they are created  individually. The union induces unity in the flesh; 'shall be,'  or 'shall become' partly, though imperfectly, implies this. see  Matt. 19.5. It is not 'shall be one Spirit.' but 'he is.' The  Spirit which is in the Lord himself dwells in us, and is the  living power of the new life.>
<7:5 7:5   (b-1)  It means to 'deprive another of anything wrongfully.' so that  it has the sense of 'rob,' 'defraud;' but with the sense of  taking away, or depriving of, what another had a right to. Such  is the sense. I have said 'defraud,' as it is the same word as  in ch. 6.7,8. The sense is just the same; only here it is of  one another.>
<7:6 7:6  [to], (c-7)  Or 'permitting' it. Not 'by permission;' that would imply  that he said it by the Lord's permission. He said it in the way  of permission, not as command.>
<7:7 7:7  gift (d-17)  Charisma. see Note h, Rom. 5.16.>
<7:13 7:13  husband. (e-21)  Lit. 'the husband.'>
<7:15 7:15  them (f-8)  Lit. 'him.' see Note, ver. 28.>
<7:25 7:25  virgins, (a-3)  Whether men or women.>
<7:28 7:28  have (b-17)  Or 'she has.' I say 'they' to embrace both sexes, which the  'such' (toioutoi, plural), and what follows, distinctly  implies. The Greek for 'virgin' is feminine from its primary  natural reference, but see Rev. 14.4.>
<7:29 7:29  wives, (c-17)  It may be translated 'for the rest [I say it], in order that  even they who have wives.'>
<7:31 7:31  own; (d-14)  See Note, ch. 9.18.>
<8:1 8:1  know, (a-8)  Two Greek words are used for 'to know' in the New Testament  -- ginosko and oida. The former signifies objective  knowledge, what a man has learned or acquired. The English  expression 'being acquainted with' perhaps conveys the meaning.  Oida conveys the thought of what is inward, the inward  consciousness in the mind, intuitive knowledge not immediately  derived from what is external. The difference between the two  words is illustrated in John 8.55, 'ye know (ginosko) him  not; but I know (oida) him;' in John 13.7, 'What I do thou  dost not know (oida) now, but thou shalt know (ginosko)  hereafter;' and in Heb. 8.11, 'they shall not teach ... saying,  Know (ginosko) the Lord; because all shall know (oida) me.'  The word oida is used of Christ as knowing the Father, and as  knowing the hypocrisy of the Scribes and Pharisees, of Paul's  knowledge of a 'man in Christ,' and of the Christian's  knowledge that he has eternal life. 'I know whom I have  believed,' 2Tim. 1.12 -- I have the inward conscious knowledge  of who the person is. see also 1Cor. 16.15; 2Tim. 3.14 and 15  -- all of these refer to inward conscious knowledge. The  difference between the significance of the two words is often  slight; and objective knowledge may pass into conscious  knowledge, but not vice versa. The Greek for conscience is  derived from oida. see ch. 4.4, 'I am conscious of nothing  in myself,' that is, not conscious of any fault. In the present  passage, 'We know that an idol is nothing' is conscious  knowledge. 'we all have knowledge' and 'knowledge puffs up' is  objective knowledge. 'If any one think he knows (conscious  knowledge), he knows (objectively) nothing yet as he ought to  know it (objectively).' 'he is known (objectively) of him,' so  'knowledge,' ver. 10.>
<8:4 8:4  know (a-12)  Two Greek words are used for 'to know' in the New Testament  -- ginosko and oida. The former signifies objective  knowledge, what a man has learned or acquired. The English  expression 'being acquainted with' perhaps conveys the meaning.  Oida conveys the thought of what is inward, the inward  consciousness in the mind, intuitive knowledge not immediately  derived from what is external. The difference between the two  words is illustrated in John 8.55, 'ye know (ginosko) him  not; but I know (oida) him;' in John 13.7, 'What I do thou  dost not know (oida) now, but thou shalt know (ginosko)  hereafter;' and in Heb. 8.11, 'they shall not teach ... saying,  Know (ginosko) the Lord; because all shall know (oida) me.'  The word oida is used of Christ as knowing the Father, and as  knowing the hypocrisy of the Scribes and Pharisees, of Paul's  knowledge of a 'man in Christ,' and of the Christian's  knowledge that he has eternal life. 'I know whom I have  believed,' 2Tim. 1.12 -- I have the inward conscious knowledge  of who the person is. see also 1Cor. 16.15; 2Tim. 3.14 and 15  -- all of these refer to inward conscious knowledge. The  difference between the significance of the two words is often  slight; and objective knowledge may pass into conscious  knowledge, but not vice versa. The Greek for conscience is  derived from oida. see ch. 4.4, 'I am conscious of nothing  in myself,' that is, not conscious of any fault. In the present  passage, 'We know that an idol is nothing' is conscious  knowledge. 'we all have knowledge' and 'knowledge puffs up' is  objective knowledge. 'If any one think he knows (conscious  knowledge), he knows (objectively) nothing yet as he ought to  know it (objectively).' 'he is known (objectively) of him,' so  'knowledge,' ver. 10.>
<8:6 8:6  of (b-10)  'Of,' ek; 'for,' eis; 'by,' dia.>
<8:9 8:9  right (c-7)  Or 'liberty,' exousia. Title in a man's own conscience is  the sense. see Note, Matt. 10.1.>
<8:10 8:10  weak, (d-22)  Lit. 'the conscience of him weak.'  emboldened (e-24)  Lit. 'edified,' 'built up.'>
<9:9 9:9  For (a-1)  These two 'fors' are an example of the rapidity of the  apostle's style. To make the sense hang together, we should  have to add, in the first case, 'not as a man merely,' or,  'surely it does.' 'For in the law of Moses,' &c.; and, in the  second, 'not about the oxen, for for our sakes,' &c.
  written, (b-9)  See Deut. 25.4.>
<9:10 9:10  For (a-10)  These two 'fors' are an example of the rapidity of the  apostle's style. To make the sense hang together, we should  have to add, in the first case, 'not as a man merely,' or,  'surely it does.' 'For in the law of Moses,' &c.; and, in the  second, 'not about the oxen, for for our sakes,' &c.
  in (c-23)  Or 'with.' see Rom. 4.18.
  partaking (d-34)  Metecho, see Note q, Heb. 2.14.>
<9:12 9:12  partake (d-3)  Metecho, see Note q, Heb. 2.14.>
<9:13 9:13  things (e-11)  Or 'perform the sacred rites.'
  temple; (f-19)  Or 'of what is sacred.' It is well to distinguish naos (as  ch. 3.16), 'the house,' including both parts of the house (i.e.  the holy of holies and the holy place), from hieron (the word  used here), 'the general buildings of the temple.'>
<9:18 9:18  me, (g-33)  The same word as translated in ch. 7.31, 'not disposing of it  as their own.' According to common usage it is 'to use as one  who has possession of a thing;' using it as he likes, as his  own. The apostle, as sent of the Lord to preach, had a right to  be supported; but he did not use this right. It would not have  been an abuse; but he did not use it for himself, as a thing he  possessed. He weighed the effect as to Christ's glory. 'Made  use of it' hardly fully expresses the force of it. The sense is  given in result in adding 'as belonging to me.'>
<9:19 9:19  [possible]. (h-19)  'The most possible' gives the sense. It is used for the major  part of any body, and hence for the mass opposed to leaders. It  is not 'the more,' i.e. so much the more, but the greatest  number possible, the whole mass that he could reach by these  means.>
<9:21 9:21  law, (a-4)  Anomos, 'without law'. This is important as showing the  true force of the Greek word anomia employed elsewhere, as in  1John 3.4, 'sin is lawlessness,' not 'transgression of law.'
  legitimately (b-16)  Or, 'under law to Christ' (not under the law), i.e.  rightfully, duly, subject to Him. I have said 'legitimately' to  preserve the connection with law. See Acts 19.39, 'regular,'  i.e. lawful and right.>
<9:22 9:22  events (c-28)  Or 'by all means.'>
<10:2 10:2  baptised (d-4)  The middle form of the verb, which has a reflexive force. It  is when an act returns back in its effect on oneself. see Note  e, Heb. 1.3. Paul was to act thus in Acts 22.16; not to baptise  himself, that would be active; but 'get baptised.' They passed  through the sea and so got baptised. There was no action of  course of a baptiser here, hence the middle voice.>
<10:7 10:7  written, (e-12)  See Ex. 32.6.>

<10:23 10:23  lawful, (e-4)  lawful, (e-13)
  'Are lawful' is the verb, of which exousia, the word  translated 'right' or 'liberty' in ch. 8.9, and 'power' in  Matt. 10.1, is the noun. The word translated 'liberty' in v. 29  is different, and is opposed to 'bondage,' as in John 8.32,36; 2Cor. 3.17; Gal. 5.13.>
<10:28 10:28  purposes, (f-13)  Or 'to a god.'>
<10:29 10:29  liberty (e-17)  'Are lawful' is the verb, of which exousia, the word  translated 'right' or 'liberty' in ch. 8.9, and 'power' in  Matt. 10.1, is the noun. The word translated 'liberty' in v. 29  is different, and is opposed to 'bondage,' as in John 8.32,36; 2Cor. 3.17; Gal. 5.13.>

<11:24 11:24  me. (i-22)  'For the calling of me to mind.' The word translated  'remembrance' has an active signification of 'recalling' or  'calling to mind,' as a memorial. Cf. Heb. 10.3, 'a calling to  mind of sins.'>

<11:29 11:29  judgment (m-9)  Krima, i.e. anything that can be laid to our charge, or the  subject of a judge's sentence. As 'sentence of guilt,' Rom. 13.2. Christ's krima was written on the cross.>
<11:31 11:31  ourselves, (n-5)  'Judged ourselves' is not the same in Greek as 'judged,'  used later in this ver. and in ver. 32, but as 'distinguish  the Lord's body,' ver. 29. But 'distinguish' does not imply the  active exercise of judgment on our own state, nor a formal  scrutiny. Here the force is, If I scrutinize and judge myself,  I shall not come under an actual judgment from the Lord's hand.  Judging oneself has this force in English, while the Lord's  judgment is felt to be a positive result of judgment exercised  towards us.>

<12:23 12:23  honour, (e-16)  Possibly 'less honourable.' It is a question whether the  apostle is referring to the 'uncomely' parts, or to the comely  ones which yet have not such a place as the face.>

<13:12 13:12  window (g-8)  That is, through some medium which, in degree, hinders  vision. The word means also 'a mirror,' but it is used for  window, made, not of clear transparent glass, as now, but of  semi-transparent materials. In this verse, 'know' (partially)  is ginosko, the words used for 'know' and 'known' in the last  clause of the verse are from epiginosko, which is stronger,  as in Matt. 11.27.>
<14:1 14:1  emulous (h-6)  Or 'desire earnestly,' as vers. 12 and 39, and ch. 12.31.>
<14:9 14:9  ye (a-8)  Or 'ye, unless by means of the tongue, ye,' &c. In either  case 'tongue' means the language he spoke, not the organ of  speech.>
<14:12 14:12  spirits, (b-9)  'Spiritual gifts,' though in sum the sense, deprives the  phrase of its force here. As Gentiles, they were in danger of  confounding demons' action with the Holy Spirit; and they did  not adequately hold the unity of the Spirit, but looked for a  spirit's power and action to distinguish themselves. The  apostle was obliged to point out the difference between demons  and the Holy Spirit. But the word further tends to show the  reality of a personal spirit acting, though for the Christian  there be but one, the Spirit of God.>

<15:12 15:12  raised (a-9)  'Are not raised,' vers. 15,16, applies to the abstract fact  whenever it may be; the doctrinal fact as to dead people; 'he  (Christ) is raised,' vers. 12,13,16,20, is an accomplished but  continuing fact. The English tenses do not always secure this  distinction. I have not put 'do not rise,' because then the  thought of being raised by God is lost.>
<15:15 15:15  raised. (a-34)  'Are not raised,' vers. 15,16, applies to the abstract fact  whenever it may be; the doctrinal fact as to dead people; 'he  (Christ) is raised,' vers. 12,13,16,20, is an accomplished but  continuing fact. The English tenses do not always secure this  distinction. I have not put 'do not rise,' because then the  thought of being raised by God is lost.>

The English tenses do not always secure this  distinction. I have not put 'do not rise,' because then the  thought of being raised by God is lost.>
<15:23 15:23  rank. (b-6)  * A military term.>
<15:24 15:24  Father; (c-16)  It is almost impossible to render the Greek idiom, which  unites with one article either two qualities of the same  person, or two persons under the same quality. But I prefer  this awkward English to 'God, even the Father,' because this  phrase is uncertain in doctrine, and might be used as meaning  that the Father only is God, which is not the sense.>
<15:25 15:25  all (d-8)  Lit. 'all the enemies.' all those recognized or objectively  manifested as such.>
<15:27 15:27  feet. (e-11)  See Ps. 8.6.>

  die. (h-38)  See Isa. 22.13.>
<15:34 15:34  ignorant (i-10)  Lit. 'have ignorance.' On the whole, 'ignorant of God' gives  the sense. 'Have not the knowledge' is weak. 'No knowledge'  does not meet the case. It refers to the true character of God.>
<15:39 15:39  fishes. (a-26)  Or 'that of men is one, the flesh of beasts another, the  flesh of birds another, of fishes another.'>
<15:44 15:44  natural (b-5)  natural (b-17)
 i.e. having natural life through the living soul.>

<15:55 15:55  victory? (f-11)  See Hos. 13.14.>
<16:1 16:1  directed (g-10)  It means ordering troops, so as to set them in array; and in  general, thence, any order directing any plan to be followed.>
<16:3 16:3  letters (a-15)  It may be read 'whomsoever ye shall approve by letters, I  will send them to carry,' &c.>
<16:7 16:7  will (b-3)  Not exactly 'purpose;' but 'it is not my desire or  intention.'>
<16:12 16:12  much (c-9)  It may mean 'often,' but the word is used for 'much' in v. 19.
  will (d-26)  Or 'but it was not, at any rate, his will.'>
<16:14 16:14  do (e-5)  Lit. 'all your things.'>
<16:15 16:15  know (f-7)  Oida. It refers to their inward acquaintance with their  qualities, not objective knowledge.
  themselves (g-23)  'Devoted themselves,' &c. In sum this is the sense; but the  force of the apostle's phrase is not wholly given. The Greek  word means 'appointed to,' as an officer to a regiment. The  family of Stephanas had appointed themselves to the saints for  service -- given themselves up to serve them, or rather given  themselves up to them. 'The saints' is governed by the verb,  not by 'service.' The idea resulting from what I have given in  the text is more what the apostle means.>

<1:4 1:4  encourages (a-2)  Parakaleo, as Matt. 2.18; 5.4; Acts 20.12; 1Thess. 3.7. I  do not say 'comfort,' as that is rather conveyed in  paramutheomai, so translated in 1Thess. 2.11; 5.14;  'console,' John 11.19,31; and 'consolation,' 1Cor. 14.3. The  difference is slight, but here, as in Acts 20, there is the  sense of 'cheered,' and this might replace 'encourage' and  'encouragement' if there were a suitable noun.>
<1:5 1:5  Christ (b-8)  I would take this opportunity of drawing attention to the  difference between 'Christ' and 'the Christ.' 'The Christ' is a  title, the designation of a condition or office, not a name;  'Christ' is a name. These are not used indifferently, and in  the Gospels, where in Greek the word occurs alone, it is almost  invariably 'the Christ,' the Messiah, or Anointed; while in the  Epistles it is rarely so, but is used as a name. Some cases are  doubtful, because the structure of the Greek phrase requires or  prefers the article. this is the case here. However, on the  whole I believe the article should be inserted here in English.  When the article is inserted in this translation, the office or  condition is considered to be the prominent thought.>
<1:9 1:9  in (c-21)  * Lit. 'the God who raises,' &c.>
<1:12 1:12  God, (d-17)  Lit. 'simplicity and sincerity of God.' The force I take to  be, 'such as God would have, and God would produce.' As we say,  'That is the stroke of a master,' 'the act of a prince.'  'Godly' seems to me feeble, but not wrong. One cannot say 'of  God' here.>
<1:13 1:13  know (e-14)  Or 'own' (personally). Some would render this 'but what ye  read.' The word has this sense also; but it refers here, I  think, to what they knew and had learnt of him by his being  amongst them.
  recognise (a-23)  Epiginosko, 'know well,' as Matt. 7.16 and 11.27.>
<1:19 1:19  Silvanus (b-20)  * i.e. Silas, Acts 18.5.
  *is* (c-31)  The apostle here changes from the aorist 'did not become' to  the perfect tense of the same verb, translated 'is.' He is not  speaking of the character of his preaching, but declaring that  the verification of all divine truth is in the Person of  Christ.>
<1:20 1:20  us. (d-23)  Or 'with' or 'before God, for glory by us.' It may be read  thus. 'was not yea and nay, but in him is the yea, (for  whatsoever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in  him the amen,) for glory to God by us.'>
<1:21 1:21  in (e-8)  Eis. lit. 'unto.' The word translated 'establishes ... in'  means 'attaches firmly to,' 'connects firmly with.'>
<2:3 2:3  [letter] (f-7)  Some refer this phrase to his first letter. In this case it  must be translated, 'and I wrote the very (letter I did).' But  I think touto auto can hardly mean that; and in the following  words he refers it to the present time, when he was coming.  It is evident that, if egrapsa (ver. 4) refers to his first  letter, it must be translated 'I wrote;' but ekrina, 'I have  judged,' (ver. 1) refers to the general determination of his  mind. Egrapsa clearly often refers to what is written in the  letter that contains it, and then we must say in English, 'I  have written.'>
<2:4 2:4  wrote (g-11)  This, I think, must refer to the first epistle, as he was now  much relieved through the news Titus brought. It is again  egrapsa.>
<2:6 2:6  rebuke (h-8)  Or 'penalty.'
  many; (i-15)  The body at large -- 'the mass,' as ch. 9.2.>
<2:7 2:7  grace (k-10)  Or 'forgive,' as ver. 10; Luke 7.42.>
<2:10 2:10  forgiven, (a-15)  forgiven (a-19)
  The perfect tense. he had done it, but it continued as a  present thing.>
<2:15 2:15  odour (b-6)  An allusion to the Roman triumphal processions, in which  sweet odours were used, and when often many captives were  killed, while others were spared. The 'sweet odour' was  therefore unto death or unto life, as the gospel when received  is a means of life, but when not received, however sweet it may  be, is only a cause for condemnation.>
<2:17 2:17  of (c-11)  Or 'adulterate.' properly 'to retail.'>
<3:2 3:2  read (d-11)  The Greek means also 'well known;' a thing read of all, not  private. There is a play on words, giving force to the  statement. 'read' being a compound of 'know.' see ch. 1.13.>
<3:3 3:3  be (e-4)  Lit. '[ye] being manifested that ye are.'>
<3:5 3:5  competent (f-5)  I do not particularly prefer 'competent' to 'sufficient,' (as  in ch. 2.16) but the sense is lost in ver. 6, if we say  'sufficient' there.>
<3:6 3:6  covenant; (g-12)  The omission of the article makes it characteristic, as in  the case of 'letter' and 'spirit;' perhaps it may be rendered  'competent [as] new covenant ministers.'
  kills, (h-22)  Or 'For letter kills.'>
<3:7 3:7  began (i-12)  It is not said that the ministry was glorious, but that the  system was introduced with glory. It is in contrast with  'subsist in glory' (ver. 8).
  Moses, (k-30)  See Ex. 34.29-35.>
<3:11 3:11  annulled (a-4)  'That annulled,' or 'done away,' may appear a little harsh,  but the apostle uses it as a formula for the old covenant done  away in Christ. If this be borne in mind, the sense will be  clearer by the use of it. It contrasts 'that annulled' with  'that which abides.' so vers. 13 and 14.>
<3:14 3:14  darkened, (b-6)  As 'hardened,' Mark 3.5; 'blinded,' Rom. 11.7.
  annulled. (c-25)  I have no doubt that the text is right, and that Moses  covered his face while he talked to the people, and that the  Hebrew, Ex. 34.33, means nothing else, and ver. 34 proves it.>
<3:16 3:16  away.) (d-13)  The parenthesis begins at ver. 7.>
<3:18 3:18  transformed (e-15)  As Rom. 12.2. From metamorphoo, translated 'transfigured'  in Matt. 17.2 and Mark 9.2.

<4:2 4:2  shame, (g-9)  i.e. all that of which one is ashamed and therefore keeps  concealed.>
<4:3 4:3  lost; (h-15)  Or 'that perish,' as ch. 2.15.>
<4:4 4:4  forth (i-38)  I add 'for them' to complete the sense. I have doubted as to  this passage. The word translated 'shine forth' is only found  here in the New Testament and generally means 'to see,' or  'discern.' If this be the meaning here, we should read 'so that  they should not discern the shining forth of the glad tidings  of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.'>
<4:6 4:6  God (k-5)  Or '[it is] God.'
  shine (l-14)  Lit. 'who spoke light to shine out of darkness.'
  forth (m-24)  'Shining forth,' or 'radiancy;' the same word as translated  'radiancy' in ver. 4.>
<4:10 4:10  dying (n-8)  Or 'putting to death.' The word implies the moral character  of death, not only the fact of death. The same word is used in  Rom. 4.19, 'the deadening' of Sarah's womb.>
<4:13 4:13  written, (a-12)  See Ps. 116.10.>
<4:15 4:15  many (b-14)  'Grace abounding through the many.' The grace of God, perfect  in itself, multiplies itself in its objects, so that  thanksgiving abounds. Paul was delivered, but everything was  for the assembly. It was not therefore merely a benefit to him,  but still more to all, so that the grace or benefit was  multiplied, and caused thanksgiving to abound to God's glory.  The form of thought is peculiar, but the sense plain and  striking.>
<4:17 4:17  light (c-5)  Lit. 'the momentary lightness of our.'>
<4:18 4:18   (d-1)  'While' has not the sense of time here. The literal  translation, 'we not looking,' would convey a somewhat  causative sense, which is not the force of the passage.>
<5:1 5:1  house (e-9)  'Tabernacle' is characteristic.>
<5:2 5:2  from (f-17)  Ek. 'out of.'>
<5:4 5:4  yet (g-13)  Or 'though meanwhile,' 'yet in such sort that.' It is a  necessary condition of the right understanding of ver. 4.  'Clothed' is the same word as 'to have put on' in ver. 2. For  'groan,' vers. 2 and 4, see Mark 7.34.>
<5:6 5:6  know (h-7)  Lit. 'knowing' (from oida, conscious knowledge). It was  their state; confident and knowing.
  present (i-10)  absent (i-16)
  The Greek words translated 'present' and 'absent' are  literally 'at home' and 'away from home.'>
<5:10 5:10  in (k-20)  'The things which in their accomplishment have their seat  there.'>
<5:11 5:11  been (l-13)  been (l-24)
  Or 'are manifested.' It is the perfect tense; what is done  and of which the effect continues.>
<5:12 5:12  countenance, (a-31)  As 'appearance,' ch. 10.1.>
<5:13 5:13  God; (b-10)  Or 'for God;' that is, he was as a fool for God's glory. But  the sense is, I think, 'If he lost the blessed calculations of  love which was his path towards men, it was to be out of  himself with God, and for God.' a blessed alternative. His  ecstasy was not excitement or folly, but if out of himself it  was with God; if sober, it was the calculation of love for  their good.>
<5:14 5:14  died; (c-20)  Or 'had died.' It is the aorist, and refers to the state  Christ's death proved them to be in, in a state of nature. To  make it a consequence of Christ's death is, I judge, an utter  blunder.>
<5:15 5:15  them (d-22)  'For them' may apply to both 'died' and 'been raised,' but I  think 'raised' is supplementary and by itself.>
<5:16 5:16  know (e-5)  known (e-16)  know (e-24)
  Here the first 'know' is 'conscious,' the second and third  are objective. see Note, 1Cor. 8.1.>
<5:18 5:18  that (f-24) Or simply 'of reconciliation.'>
<5:19 5:19  that (f-25)  Or simply 'of reconciliation.'>
<5:20 5:20  were] (g-10)  'As of God beseeching;' 'as though,' or 'as if,' is too much  similarity or comparison. God being in Christ, and they  Christ's ambassadors, they besought on God's behalf. He was as  beseeching by them. The apostle will not say God was  beseeching, but softens it by 'as it were.' yet it amounted to  that, as done on his behalf. It is difficult to translate,  though the sense is most evident and beautiful.>
<6:1 6:1  fellow-workmen, (h-3)  See 1Cor. 3.9. Here literally 'jointly labouring;' the  connection is in the word 'beseech.'>
<6:2 6:2  salvation. (i-22)  See Isa. 49.8.>
<6:4 6:4  endurance, (k-11)  Or 'patience.'>
<6:9 6:9  known; (l-5)  Or 'recognized,' as Matt. 7.16.>
<6:10 6:10  grieved, (m-2)  Or 'sorrowful.'>
<6:11 6:11  expanded. (a-11)  I do not say 'enlarged,' because it would lead one to suppose  that his heart had been narrow. He had been driven in, as it  were, by their evil, and now opened out and expanded.>
<6:12 6:12  affections; (b-13)  Lit. 'bowels.'>
<6:13 6:13  itself. (c-16)  Lit. 'be ye also expanded.'>
<6:14 6:14  diversely (d-3)  'Unequally,' as in A.V., is a consequence, but not stated in  the text, which says 'diversely,' referring to the Levitical  law, which forbade different animals to be yoked together,  Deut. 22.10.>
<6:16 6:16  temple (e-6)  temple; (e-15)

<6:17 6:17  Lord, (g-14) 'Lord' is a proper name, answering to Jehovah. God, who in  the Old Testament took the name of Jehovah with Israel, and of  Shaddai (Almighty) with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, takes the  name of Father with us.

<7:8 7:8  also (l-3)  even (l-16)  even (l-28)
  'If also' and 'if even' (twice) in this verse represent the  same Greek expression. The first is translated 'if also,'  which, while literal, is more delicate, as expression of  feeling, than 'though.' 'If even' would here express an extreme  case or doubt; 'also' is admitting an additional fact. Hence I  put 'if even' for the other cases in the sentence. In the  second case he suggests in the way of admission, as the extreme  to which he went, i.e. regret. he was right and inspired, but  felt the distress individually, and would not leave them  ignorant of how far his love went; so in the third case it is  the same limitation of their grief. 'Ye were sorry, if even it  were only for a time.'>
<7:11 7:11  much (a-13)  Or 'what.'>
<7:12 7:12  God. (b-43)  Or perhaps 'for the sake of our diligent zeal for you before  God being manifested to you.' The reading is uncertain here. It  is possible that the true reading is 'your zeal for us.' Its  force then would be, 'that you might discern how truly you  loved us, though turned aside by false teachers.' Compare ver. 7.>
<7:13 7:13  encouraged. (c-7)  Or 'have been comforted.'
  in (d-13)  Or 'besides' or 'in addition to.'
  encouragement (e-15)  Or 'in our comfort.'
  abundantly (f-17)  'The rather ... more abundantly.' This is a common Greek  idiom, but it is impossible to render it exactly in English.  The A.V. translates the expression 'exceedingly the more,'  but in English 'the more' supposes more than something, and  because of something. I do not think it always merely  emphatic; there is an unexpressed motive which is the cause of  'the rather' in the mind. I suspect that ver. 14 gives the clue  to the force of it.
  all. (g-33)  It may, perhaps, be translated 'and in (or 'besides') our  encouragement we the rather rejoiced more abundantly in the joy  of Titus (for his spirit is refreshed by you all), because if  I,' &c. There are often examples of the change of 'I' and 'we'  in this epistle; it is the case in this very context. But not  without a reason in the sense, 'I' being more personal to Paul.>
<7:15 7:15  affections (h-3)  Lit. 'bowels.'>
<8:4 8:4  grace (i-12)  The 'grace' here is not the collection, but the grace and  favour shown to the poor in the gift. Instead of Paul having to  press this grace on the Macedonians, they beg of him the grace  and fellowship (koinonia) of the administration; that is, to  be the instrument (though an apostle) of its manifestation by  them. The 'grace and fellowship' is the active exercise of  grace towards the Jewish saints. This they begged of Paul. (See  ver. 19.)>
<8:6 8:6  that (k-2)  'So that we were led to beg,' 'leading us to beg.' 'So that'  states the effect produced; the tendency of the grace among the  Macedonians he had been speaking of.
  to (a-19)  Or 'with.'>
<8:7 8:7   (b-1)  'But,' not 'therefore' (as in A.V.). The apostle means 'but  it is,' or 'my object in doing so is,' or 'what I have in my  mind in thus sending Titus is.'>
<8:9 8:9  *his* (c-25)  The 'his' is emphatic. 'the poverty of such a one as he.'>
<8:12 8:12  accepted (d-10)  Or 'it is accepted.'>
<8:15 8:15  written, (e-5)  See Ex. 16.18.>

<9:5 9:5  blessing, (a-21)  'Blessing.' The sense is plain, though the word is unusual. I  note it in view of verse 6. It is the spirit in which a man  gives. as God gives, freely to bless, so ought we. and such as  so give shall so reap from him.

<10:4 10:4  God (i-14)  Or 'divinely powerful,' as a Hebraism; or 'in a divine way',  before God, in His view; bringing Him in; or 'through God.'  Moses was 'beautiful to God' or 'divinely beautiful' (Acts 7.20).>

<10:8 10:8  overthrowing, (a-28)  See ch. 13.10.>
<10:12 10:12  intelligent. (b-28)  'Wise' is not the sense here, at least it seems to give the  sense of 'not being wise in doing so,' which is not the force  of the Greek expression. The force is 'do not perceive,'  whether in capacity or fact. See Matt. 13.13; Mark 4.12; 6.52,  7.14; 8.17,21; Rom. 3.11; 15.21.>
<10:13 10:13  measure, (c-8)  There is a double meaning in the words here. They signify  'out of measure, immoderately,' but allude also here to the  false teachers going where God had not sent them. see ver.15.>
<10:17 10:17  Lord. (d-10)  See 1Cor. 1.31.>
<11:3 11:3  simplicity (e-23)  'Simplicity' here refers, not to a personal trait, but to the  doctrine as to Christ; what a faithful heart retained in  simplicity, as taught in the truth. To say 'which [is] in the  Christ,' is too much as if it were in Christ himself, not the  doctrine.>
<11:6 11:6  simple (f-6)  As 'uninstructed,' Acts 4.13.
  you. (g-25)  Or 'before you.'>
<11:8 11:8  ministry (h-8)  Diakonia. see Note, 1Cor. 4.1.>
<11:23 11:23  ministers (a-3)  Diakonos. see Note. 1Cor. 4.1.
  [so]; (b-15)  The word here translated 'above measure' is so used  constantly by the apostle, though not indeed separated from the  word it refers to. But I do not find that it is used  adverbially for 'more than;' and the expression 'as being  beside myself' seems to refer to the extra-ordinariness of what  he was saying, for he felt that to say 'minister of Christ'  was to say all that was excellent. Hence he does not repeat 'in  folly,' but says 'as being beside myself,' 'wandering quite  away from a right mind.' His own heart did not allow him to say  he was 'minister of Christ' without judging the expression,  though forced to use it for these foolish Corinthians. The word  translated 'exceedingly abundant' is not really a comparison,  and the words translated 'to excess' and 'oft' show that no  comparison with others is instituted. He left his miserable  competitor far behind, and his soul turned back with true  heartfelt satisfaction to all he had undergone for Christ. His  folly is given to us for gain by God. However, if anyone prefer  'more than they' or 'beyond them' to 'above measure,' in result  the sense is not altered, though, it seems to me, feebler and  more disjointed.>

<11:28 11:28  burden (e-16)  'Burden' here means any solicitude or anxiety, but 'care'  misleads, because it conveys the idea of taking care of, which  is not the sense. Same word as 'anxious care,' Matt. 13.22, and  'care,' 1Pet. 5.7.>

The  Greek has the force of 'taking out,' as distinguished or  appropriated to something, though doubtless meaning 'to  separate.' I have therefore said 'set apart.'>

<5:4 5:4  profit (i-6)  The word translated here 'deprived of all profit' is hard to  translate. The active form means to render anything useless and  unprofitable, or miss an opportunity; as 'annulled,' Eph. 2.15.  Here it is passive and with the preposition (apo) 'from.'  Hence it is to be deprived of the profit or effect of anything.  It is used in Rom. 7.6 ('we are clear') in the same form as  here, for our deliverance from under the law; only there it  refers not to profit, but to the action of the law. It had for them become void of effect. So here Christ. What the word  speaks of is, not separation from Christ personally, but from  what is for us in him.>

<1:3 1:3  with (c-16)  'With' does not quite give the force. The preposition (en)  here conveys something of the power and value of what is  enjoyed; gives the blessing characteristically. see Note c,  Matt. 3.11.>
<1:5 1:5  beforehand (d-5)  The word translated 'marked out beforehand' involves purpose.  It is not 'counsel,' though it is 'according to the good  pleasure of his will,' and, in ver. 11, 'according to his  purpose,' and 'according to the counsel of his own will.' The  word horizo means 'mark out,' 'determine,' as in Rom. 1.4;  here pro (beforehand) is prefixed. It refers generally to  persons, but is applied to things as in 1Cor. 2.7. When applied  to persons, that to which they are destined is always added.

<1:6 1:6  favour (f-16)  'Taken us into his favour,' i.e. 'put us into a position of  grace and favour.' The Greek word is used here and Luke 1.28.  'Accepted us' is too formal a doctrine here. 'Shown us grace or  favour' does not give the force, for then 'the Beloved' would  be merely the instrument. It is 'in the Beloved' that we enter  into favour. An alternative reading is, 'the favour or  acceptance in grace, which he has freely bestowed upon us.'>
<1:14 1:14  to (g-8)  Or 'up to,' eis. It is more than 'till,' because it has the  inheritance in view. Compare Gal. 3.24.

<2:21 2:21  [the] (a-4)  I judge that the correct reading in the Greek is without the  article. This construction directs the mind to all the  component parts of the thing in question. So here the building  is not viewed as one completed thing but was 'growing to' a  temple (naos). He is looking at a building composed of living  stones as a whole, but mentally apprehended as composed of many  parts. Among these, in Christ, the Gentiles at Ephesus were  built in too, to be now already a habitation of God by the  presence of the Spirit.>
<3:1 3:1  prisoner (b-6)  Lit. 'the one in bonds.'>
<3:7 3:7  minister (c-6)  Diakonos. see Note, 1Cor. 4.1.>
<3:9 3:9  ages (d-19)  Or 'from eternity.' literally 'from the ages;' but in the  sense of the period elapsed, not 'hidden from them.'>
<3:11 3:11  ages, (e-7)  Or 'eternal purpose.'>
<3:14 3:14  Christ], (f-15)  Many reject the words 'of our Lord Jesus Christ.' But as they  are well supported by manuscripts and the most ancient versions  and fathers I have not struck them out, though disposed to  think them an addition.>
<3:15 3:15  family (g-4)  There is a distinct connection between the Greek words for  Father and family.>
<3:21 3:21  Amen). (a-19)  Ch. 3, except ver. 1, is a parenthesis.>
<4:1 4:1  wherewith (b-16)  Or 'according to which.'>
<4:3 4:3  bond (c-13)  It is not only 'bond,' but the 'bond-together.' It is not the  power of union -- that is the Holy Spirit; but the practically  uniting in fact, as amongst men on earth.>
<4:4 4:4  body (d-4)  It may be translated '[the] body is one,' and so on. If we  could leave out 'there is' or 'is', the force would be so much  the greater.>
<4:8 4:8  says, (e-3)  See Ps. 68.18.>
<4:12 4:12   (f-1)  Pros. it directs attention to the object when reached, or  when the subject is at, or with the object. 'The Word was with  (pros) God,' John 1.1 Eis 'with a view to' here, and 'at'  three times, ver. 13, refers to the object in the mind of the  person. See Mark 11.1, where 'to' (twice) is eis, and 'at' is  pros.
  Christ; (g-26)  Or 'of the Christ.'>
<4:13 4:13  knowledge (h-14)  'Full knowledge,' as ch. 1.17; Col. 1.9.>
<4:14 4:14  in (i-22)  The form of the Greek phrase makes it somewhat difficult to  translate. I do not think that the phrase 'in the sleight of,'  &c., is in connection with 'tossed and carried about,' but, in  sense, with 'that teaching.' The cheating, as of dice-players,  and still more methodic craft, characterized the teaching. 'In  the sleight of men' marks the power and character of the  teaching. What I have given is literal, and is sufficiently  clear. 'that' is emphatic.>
<4:16 4:16  supply, (k-14)  The word 'supply' in Greek has the emphatic article and it  might read 'that supply, [which is] according to.' The article  denotes a known supply from Christ. sufficiently known to be  referred to, to which also the 'from whom' lends force.>
<4:17 4:17  as (a-16)  Lit. 'as also,' or 'even as.'>
<4:21 4:21  in (b-16)  There is an emphatic article before 'Jesus.' 'Jesus' is  personally brought into relief.>
<4:22 4:22  conversation (c-10)  i.e. manner of life.

<4:25 4:25  falsehood, (f-5)  Everything that has the character and nature of falsehood. It  is abstract, what has this quality, not merely the act of  lying.>
<4:27 4:27  for (g-4)  Or 'give way to.'>
<4:29 4:29  corrupt (h-3)  Or 'filthy;' a figure drawn from what is evil and bad, as  fruit. see Matt. 7.17-18 'worthless.'>

<5:4 5:4  foolish (n-4)  Perhaps 'indecent.'
  jesting, (o-7)  Used for 'buffoonery.'
  convenient; (p-11)  'Convenient' has the French sense of convenir (see Col.  3.18, Philem. 8, 'fitting'), but no other word exactly suits.  Perhaps 'becoming' or 'suitable.'>
<5:5 5:5  lust, (m-19)  As 'greedy unsatisfied lust,' ch. 4.19. It means the lust of  having, but is not confined to gain. see Mark. 7.22.
  knowing (q-8)  'Informed of' is conscious knowledge; 'knowing' is objective  knowledge.>

<5:19 5:19  hymns (f-7)  Humnos, as Col. 3.16. The verb humneo, from the same  root, is found in Matt. 26.30; Mark 14.26; Acts 16.25; and Heb. 2.12.>
<5:20 5:20  is] (g-12)  'To him who is.' This alone gives the sense. 'God, even the  Father,' might be taken as meaning that the Father only is God,  and it is far from exact as a translation.>
<5:23 5:23  husband (h-3)  Aner, 'man,' when not the race, and 'husband' are the same  word in Greek; but the article is left out here. It is in his  character of man, as contrasted with woman, that this headship  belongs to him. It is the same word as 'husband' in what  follows, only there it has the article.
  wife, (i-8)  Or 'woman.'>
<5:26 5:26  purifying (k-8)  Or having purified.' The aorists 'loved' -- 'delivered' --  'sanctify' -- 'purifying' may be coincident or consequent one  on another.>

<6:12 6:12  [power] (f-24)  Or 'powers.'>
<6:13 6:13  take (g-4)  'Take,' 'taken,' vers, 13 and 16, are aorists. The sense is  'taking up,' as arms or clothes to put on. taking a person with  you, 2Tim. 4.11.
  things, (h-26)  Or 'having overcome all things.' It is to 'carry through and  put in execution all that is purposed and called for, in spite  of opposition.'>
<6:15 6:15  preparation (i-7)  Or 'readiness,' 'willingness,' 'preparedness.'>
<6:16 6:16  inflamed (k-20)  Or 'burning.' such darts with burning stuff at the end were  in use.>
<6:17 6:17   (l-1)  Lit. 'receive' (aorist imperative). This is not as active or  energetic a word as 'take,' vers. 13,16. Perhaps there is  instruction in this.>

<1:9 1:9  abound (h-9)  It is a question how far the abounding applies to the love  itself; or, supposing the love, that it should grow in these  qualities. It is, I think, determined to be the latter by Eph. 1.8. It means 'grow in these,' yet love that would grow in  them.>

<2:1 2:1  comfort (g-6)  'Encouragement,' by word or any way. The apostle beautifully  alludes to what he felt by their sending supply to him from so  far; and adds, If you want me to be fully happy, be at one  among yourselves.>
<2:2 2:2  that (h-4)  'That' depends on an understood exhortation.>

<3:3 3:3  God, (a-12)  T.R. reads 'God in spirit.' The reading was in question as  early as Ambrose and Augustine. Augustine reads both. Ambrose,  till the Benedictine edition, was given as reading Theo(i),  'serving God the Spirit.' but they give Theou, 'serving the  Spirit of God.' The diplomatic evidence is in favour of  Theou, 'who worship by the Spirit of God.' but I do not feel  assured of its correctness. {aleph} has Theou; but after all  {aleph} is only an Alexandrian witness of the completest kind.  But it is anything but a correct manuscript. In Revelation it  is very incorrect indeed. D and P (in Tisch. M.S.I.) read  Theo-(i), and so Am Syrr.>

<3:7 3:7  in (g-8)  Epi with a dative. Here, and in 2Cor. 7.7, the apostle  states what gave occasion for comfort to him -- the  circumstance, not the cause. It is a similar construction in  ver. 9. 'for all the joy.' We can say 'for' perhaps there, but  it is the occasion of his thanksgiving; his thanksgiving was  conditional; that was necessary to it as a condition precedent.>
<3:11 3:11  himself, (a-6)  The one article in Greek refers 'God and Father' to one  person, without necessarily referring 'our' to more than  Father, which it follows in Greek. 'Now may himself [who is]  God and our Father.'
  direct (b-11)  Here 'direct' in Greek is in the singular; God the Father and  Christ the Lord forming, so to speak, one in the apostle's  mind, though, personally, clearly distinguished.>
<3:12 3:12  you, (c-2)  'You' is in contrast with 'our ... to you.'>
<3:13 3:13  holiness (d-11)  Hagiosune. See Note i at Rom. 1.4.>
<4:1 4:1  please (e-29)  I do not say 'to please,' because then pleasing God would be  a distinct object. Here it is rather 'to walk so as to please.'  The point is, the 'how,' that is, the manner of doing it, not  that it ought to be an object, however true that may be.>
<4:3 4:3  will (f-5)  The article is not before 'will' in Greek, and the force is  much increased thereby. It is not merely the fact that God  wills so, but it is a matter of God's will. God is looked at as  a person in authority (not merely a divine Being), but the will  is looked at characteristically, not merely as a fact that he  so wills. This is of such a character that God himself wills  it.
  sanctification, (g-10)  Hagiasmos. See Note i at Rom. 1.4.>
<4:4 4:4  sanctification (g-13)  Hagiasmos. See Note i at Rom. 1.4.
  possess (h-8)  The Greek is not, I think, 'acquire,' but 'come into  possession of,' the difference being great in moral things.  What I possess myself of, I possess when the action is complete  and permanent. Thus Luke 18.12; 21.19. You cannot say 'acquire  your souls by patience.' 'Keep,' 'preserve,' is a kindred sense  of the word.>
<4:6 4:6  matter, (i-12)  A mild expression for intercourse with a female, as his wife  or another's.>

<5:8 5:8  hope (a-23)  Compare 1Cor. 13.13. 'faith, hope, love, these three things.'>
<5:22 5:22  wickedness. (b-7)  The distinction between the expressions 'the right' and the  word translated 'wickedness' (lit. 'evil') without an article  is profoundly beautiful. The latter is looked at as a general  thing, a genus, and has kinds or species. They were to hold  fast 'the right,' the thing in itself. But we cannot speak of  evil in itself as an abstract existence. Its most absolute form  is Satan (as 'the wicked one,' see Matt. 13.19), though we may  practically speak of 'evil,' but I cannot say 'evilness' as I  can 'goodness.' I must suppose an existence of what is good to  have an idea of evil. But if I say ' wickedness,' I think of an  act or of evil will in someone, malice, and this gives the  sense here.>

'that of  our Lord Jesus Christ.' 'We are called to obtention of glory,  [that] of our Lord Jesus Christ.'>

<1:16 1:16  of (b-24)  As 'outline,' 2Tim. 1.13. It is a mistake to confine  delineation to long-suffering, and so make 'of' mean 'for.'  'for those,' &c. Paul was a delineation of Christ's ways in  their case, even, I doubt not, in the case of the rebellious  Jews hereafter. the whole long-suffering was in Paul's case, so  as to picture every case. In those who companied with Christ  when alive this was not so, though the grace was really the  same; but there was not the same showing forth of it.>
<1:18 1:18  charge, (c-2)  As 'enjoin,' vers. 3,5.
  that (d-20)  I have left the ambiguity as in Greek. I apprehend the series  of ideas in the apostle's mind is. he commits -- in order that;  but he refers to the prophecies -- that by them. The 'as to  thee' is more closely connected with prophecies.>
<1:19 1:19   (e-1)  Or 'holding fast,' as 2Tim. 1.13.
  faith (f-2)  The word 'faith' embraces two ideas. doctrine, as taught of  God and received; and subjectively the state of soul. If I have  cast off the faith, the doctrine and the state of soul are both  gone. Here 'faith' (first time) is the inward energy of grace  which holds fast the truth. The two are not separated, but the  state of the soul is first in the apostle's mind. In the  second, they, having put away a good conscience, did not hold  fast the faith, but lost it in some way thus objectively. In  this second case, there is the article in Greek, which does not  exclude faith in the soul, but leads the mind to the faith. In  English 'the faith' would be too absolute or merely doctrinal.>

It is that which acknowledges the truth of a thing,  and to know the truth thus suggests possession of it. But 'full  knowledge' here would hardly be an appropriate translation, as  it would imply a contrast with 'partial knowledge.'>

<2:14 2:14  deceived, (e-11)  A strong form of the word, but scriptural Greek often adds  strengthening prepositions with the force little changed. see  Rom. 7.11; 16.18; 1Cor. 3.18; 2Cor. 11.3; 2Thess. 2.3, where  the same Greek word is used.>

<3:2 3:2  discreet, (g-12)  i.e. 'of sound mind,' as ch. 2.9.>
<3:6 3:6  fault (h-13)  Krima is the subject-matter of which a person had to be  accused. They set up the krima of the Lord on the cross; that  for which he came into accusation -- the charge. So it is used  here. The devil was puffed up with his own excellency, and  abode not in the truth. Hence, in a strongly taken sense, our  word 'crime.' See also Note on 1Cor. 11.29.>

<4:3 4:3  know (c-23)  Or 'acknowledge.' from the same root as 'knowledge' in ch. 2.4.>
<4:5 4:5  addressing (d-10)  It means 'intercourse with a person,' then 'petitions and  intercession;' one person speaking personally to another. (See  Note, ch. 2.1, same Greek word.) The creature, fallen through  Adam, belongs to the faithful, and those who know the truth, by  God's speaking to them, and their freely speaking to him. This  has set all on a new footing, because we have met God again,  the word of God having put us into communication by grace. And  the 'faithful, and those who know the truth,' have availed  themselves of it, and come and enter into intercourse. It is no  longer by nature, but by the word of God.>

<5:14 5:14  respect (b-20)  Or 'by reason of.' The sense is, the favour borne to  anything; sometimes it is an object, sometimes a pleasing  motive. The adversary found in the reproach a motive to  exercise his hostility. As to 'adversary,' the habit of Paul  is to speak thus of Satan directly when acting through men,  because he knew the activity of the adversary, and the part he  takes in such matters. To such an adversary reproach is a  favoured, accepted motive.>

<1:12 1:12  believed, (i-20)  Pisteuo, 'believe,' occurs in different constructions; with  the dative, as here, it means, 'to believe a person or thing;'  compare Matt. 21.25; John 5.24 and 47. Followed by eis with  an accusative, as frequently in John, it is to believe on a  person as an object of faith, as John 14.1 ('ye believe on God,  believe also on me'). Followed by epi with an accusative, it  goes on to the idea of confidence. I rest my faith on him, yet  with a more general idea of looking to him with this  confidence. It is only used thus six times, so far as I am  aware. Acts 9.42; 11.17; 16.31; 22.19; Rom. 4.5,24. Followed by  epi with a dative, it is used only in Luke 24.25, and in the  three passages where Isa. 28.16 is quoted, Rom. 9.33; 10.11; 1Pet. 2.6, where it is confidence in, or reliance upon, a  person or thing. Followed by en with a dative, it occurs more  seldom, and refers to believing in the truth of a thing,  receiving a statement as true, as Mark 1.15 ('believe in the  glad tidings').>
<1:13 1:13   (a-1)  Or 'hold fast.' Timothy had heard no form from Paul, but  words or doctrines. Hence, he was to have a summary or  outline, so as to state clearly and definitely what he did  hold. I have added '[words],' because in English 'which' might  be thought to refer to outline. The Greek means a systematic  expose, in outline, of any system of doctrine or philosophy,  as 1Tim. 1.16, 'delineation.'>
<2:2 2:2  of (b-12)  Dia. the state or circumstances in which a thing happened,  as Rom. 2.27.>

<2:10 2:10  endure (g-5)  'Endure' has a double sense in English. 'to last,' and 'to go  through suffering patiently.' Here it is the latter, as in Rom.  2.7; 8.25; Jas. 5.11.
  obtain (h-18)  Not in an active sense, but simply get it, not miss it.>
<2:12 2:12  endure, (g-3)  'Endure' has a double sense in English. 'to last,' and 'to go  through suffering patiently.' Here it is the latter, as in Rom.  2.7; 8.25; Jas. 5.11.>

<2:19 2:19   (a-1)  The Greek word affirms with certainty where doubt may have  been raised. This overthrowing might seem to call in question  God's foundation. Yet that remains firm. Speculation as to what  the foundation is is futile, particularly that of those who  speak of the invisible church. The church is founded, a  building; not a foundation. It is simply God's foundation  abstractly.>
<2:21 2:21  purified (b-6)  The word for 'purified' is only found here and 1Cor. 5.7,  'Purge out.' There it was to get rid of the old leaven out of  the lump; here the one who names the name of the Lord has to  purge himself from among the vessels. Hence we have an  additional preposition which is rendered by 'separating from.'  Lit. 'purified himself away from these.'

<2:26 2:26  *his* (g-20)  It is here a question whether it be God's will or Satan's;  whether 'for' (eis) refers to 'awake up' or 'taken captive.'  'awake up for his (God's) will out of the snare,' &c.; that  those who have been taken as prey by the devil may, God having  given them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, awake  up to follow his will. I rather prefer its application to God.>

<2:12 2:12  teaching (i-1)  This word has certainly the sense of discipline, and always  perhaps carries with it something of the thought of setting  right; but it is used unquestionably for instructing, as in  Acts 7.22, and elsewhere.
  soberly, (k-13)  That is, with self-restraint and consideration, or sound  mind; as 'discreet,' ch. 1.8.
  things, (l-23)  Aion. see Matt. 13.22, but 'age' hardly gives the sense.  'World' gives the false idea of this world as one, and heaven  another. It was, for the Jews, the present state of things in  contrast with that to be introduced by Messiah.>
<2:14 2:14  gave (m-2)  Or 'has given.' Aorist.>
<3:4 3:4  man (a-8)  Lit. 'philanthropy.'>
<3:5 3:5  washing (b-28)  'Washing' is right here. It is a bath, or the water for it.  'Regeneration' is not the same word as 'being born again,' nor  is it used so in scripture. The force of the word is a change  of position; a new state of things. The word is only used here,  and in Matt. 19.28 for the Saviour's coming kingdom.>
<3:7 3:7  *his* (c-6)  This refers to our Saviour God, ver. 4.>

  the] (i-15)  Lit. 'in Son.' The absence of the Greek article here is  important, though difficult to render in English; the result  is, that God, speaking in the prophets, and using them as his  mouth, is clearly distinct. 'in Son' is not exactly 'as Son,'  because that would be the character of the speaking, yet is  perhaps the nearest to an adequate expression. It is God  himself who speaks; not by another; not as the Father nor in  the person of the Father; not merely by the Holy Spirit using a  person not divine, but as himself a divine person, and that  person the Son.

Though we, as alone the  sinners, have the profit, yet the work was done within his own  person and work, without us, as when a man journeys, and so  when he makes a person his friend, his wife.>

  son? (g-36)  See 1Chron. 17.13.>
<1:6 1:6  brings (h-5)  The present tense in English gives the sense of the aorist  here. The reference is to Ps. 97, where he is just coming in,  in his kingdom glory; but, in a certain sense, he must be there  to be worshipped. His introduction is antecedent to his worship  as firstborn, but it is on introducing him that this follows  (hence the aorist), not when his whole introducing is a past  thing. The glory of the person of Christ is before the writer,  not the time of introducing. I have no doubt that the  translation I give is the only right one.

  manner, (p-14)  'In like manner' is strictly 'near to,' as Phil. 2.27, 'close  to.'
  in (q-17)  There is an intended difference here between the words for  'partake' (koinoneo) and 'took part in' (metecho), ver. 14.  The first, referring to the children, is a common equal sharing  of the nature. The second, referring to Christ, means, he took  a part in it; and refers always to something outside myself,  but which I take, or take a part in. The first work refers to a  joint participation in that which belongs to me or to known  fellowship. The second is used in ch. 5.13, 'partakes of milk,'  in 1Cor. 9.10, where the reaper gets a share in the sower's  hope, and in 1Cor. 10.17,21,30, 'partake,' where 'partaking'  (metecho) is proof of participation in fellowship  (koinonia), ver. 16. The word does not say how far the taking  share went.

<2:16 2:16  hand], (a-12)  It means 'to take hold of,' but it is constantly used for  'taking up a person to help him,' though in other senses as  well. We say, 'he took him by the hand,' but this may be too  familiar. It is used in the sense of 'taking hold of,'  literally 'deliver.' The same word is used in this verse as to  'the seed of Abraham,' and also in the quotation from Jer. 31  in ch. 8.9, but there 'hand' is added in the Greek.>
<2:17 2:17  him (b-4)  He speaks, I apprehend, historically; it was necessary for  him to do this by the alleged reason, not his present judgment  of divine necessity or purpose. 'Has behoved' would speak more  of continuance. It behoved him when he became a man. It is what  he became as man, not what he took on him.>

<3:5 3:5  his (e-8)  That is, God's house, in which Moses was faithful as a  ministering servant. The contrast is with 'Moses as a servant  in,' and 'Christ as a Son over.' The Father is not brought in  as such at all, but the Son is over the house as Son. The  connection with its being God's house is evident, because he  (Christ) has built the house, ver. 3, and he who built all  things is God; but he is over it as Son.>
<3:6 3:6  his (e-6)  That is, God's house, in which Moses was faithful as a  ministering servant. The contrast is with 'Moses as a servant  in,' and 'Christ as a Son over.' The Father is not brought in  as such at all, but the Son is over the house as Son. The  connection with its being God's house is evident, because he  (Christ) has built the house, ver. 3, and he who built all  things is God; but he is over it as Son.>

<7:14 7:14  sprung (d-9)  Or 'arisen.' It is a question whether the word alludes to  arising, as the sun, or springing up, as a plant. 'the branch.'  For 'the branch' was translated 'dayspring' by the LXX, and the  verb is used for both in Greek. see Jer. 23.5; Zech. 3.8.>

<7:24 7:24  unchangeable. (h-12)  Or 'intransmissible,' not transmitted to others.>
<7:26 7:26  holy, (i-8)  There are two Greek words used for 'holy' in the New  Testament -- hagios and hosios (hosios is used in this  passage). The word most commonly used is hagios  (corresponding to the Hebrew word kadosh). This, when applied  to God, designates him as holy, knowing good and evil  perfectly, and absolutely willing good and no evil. When  applied to men, it designates them as separated, set apart to  God from evil and from common use. The corresponding verb is  commonly translated 'to sanctify;' and the word when used as a  substantive is the ordinary word for 'saints.' The word  hosios, on the other hand, conveys the thought of pious, that  which is not profane. It speaks of God in mercy and grace, and  of Christ, in whom all gracious qualities are concentrated, as  well as perfect piety. It corresponds to the Hebrew chesed,  of which the plural (chasadim) is the word translated  'mercies' or 'sure mercies' in the Old Testament. When applied  to men, it is in general the sum of qualities which suit and  form the divine character in man, as opposed to the human will.  It refers to the exercise of gracious suitable affections in  the relationships in which we are to God, and (e.g.) to  parents. Hence, as suitable affections to God practically  constitute holiness, the word is used in this sense for holy.  The two Hebrew words are used side by side in Ps. 89.18,19,  'The Holy One (kadosh) of Israel is our king. ... Then thou  spakest in vision to thy Holy One (Chasid).' The beginning of  the Psalm speaks of the mercies or gracious ways (chasadim)  of the Lord. (See, for hosios, Acts 2.27; 13.34,35; 1Tim.  2.8; Tit. 1.8; Rev. 15.4; 16.5.)
  harmless, (a-9)  Or 'guileless,' without an evil thought.>
<7:27 7:27  all (b-33)  The word 'this' may refer to the offering for the people,  'this last.' Otherwise it would be simply 'this offering,' of  course for others, but the emphasis is on 'once for all.'>
<8:1 8:1  summary (c-3)  Or 'the chief point.' The difference is small; it expresses  what it results in, in the writer's mind, as the substance of  the things of which we are speaking. 'The things of which we  are speaking' is the present subject which occupies him. it  heads up in this.
  priest (d-19)  Or 'such a high priest.'

<8:12 8:12  never (a-17)  Or 'in no wise.' A double negative, augmenting its force.>
<8:13 8:13  New, (b-5)  Kainos. see ch. 12.24.>
<9:1 9:1  service, (c-9)  Latreia, from the same root as latreuo in ver. 6, see  Note e.
  one. (d-15)  The form of words here is greatly disputed. The grammatical  order would require it to be translated 'the holy universal  order;' but the word, it is contended, does not exist with this  sense. I have not ventured so to translate it. I doubt it to be  the same as kosmion, 'ornament.' Kosmos is 'the world,'  from the order which is in it. The tabernacle represented all  this order, the pattern of heavenly things. Hence, if  kosmikon be used, a neuter adjective for a substantive, or  coined in this use, it would mean 'the holy order of the  tabernacle, which represented the vast scene in which God's  glory is displayed in Christ.' If not, we must say, 'and the  sanctuary, a worldly one.' 'A worldly sanctuary' is not the  sense. 'A worldly sanctuary' it is not, according to regular  grammar and the constant usage of the Greek language.>
<9:6 9:6  services; (e-19)  Latreuo, as vers. 9,14; ch. 8.5; 10.2; 12.28; 13.10. see  Note l, Matt. 4.10.>
<9:7 9:7  errors (f-23)  That is, 'sins of ignorance.'>
<9:9 9:9  which (g-2)  'which is such as is.'
  which (h-12)  The present time (ver. 9) is opposed to the time of setting  things right (ver. 10). The tabernacle is in view in Hebrews,  not the temple; but the fact that offerings were then still  made is recognized in what follows. He could not call it 'the  present age' (a Jewish term for the age preceding the Messiah),  because Messiah was come and he had been crucified; but the  carnal ordinances were still offered, so that for the Hebrews  it was not 'the age to come.' The 'image' could be only for a  present time on earth. The patterns were in the heavens.
  worshipped, (i-25)  Latreuo. 'Worship' is perhaps too strong, but 'service' is  equivocal. It is to approach a god with prayers, or in offering  up a religious service. see ver. 6.>
<9:11 9:11  come, (k-12)  The 'good things to come' are the promised blessings to come  in with Christ. This Epistle, though addressed to Christians on  most precious subjects, does not enter into proper assembly  standing. it refers to the assembly in chs. 2 and 12.
  by (l-13)  Dia here gives the character of his coming. He came in the  power of and characterized by these things. They are not the  place through nor the means by which.

<9:15 9:15  covenant, (d-11)  The absence of the article makes it characteristic of him. he  is 'new (kainos) covenant mediator.' see 2Cor. 3.6.>
<9:16 9:16  testament, (e-6)  The word translated 'covenant' and 'testament' is the same;  'a disposition.' 'Covenant,' in connection with God, is a  disposition which he has made, on the ground of which man is to  be in relationship with him. But vers. 16,17, are a  parenthesis, alluding, incidentally, to another kind of  covenant.>
<9:20 9:20  saying, (f-1)  See Ex. 24.8.>
<9:24 9:24  figures (g-13)  Antitupos, meaning the impression made by a die or stamp  (tupos). The heavenly things were the original, 'the  pattern,' copied (ch. 8.5), and so it was, as said to Moses.  Hence they were the tupos; the tabernacle antitupos, here  rendered 'figure,' what answered to it.

<9:28 9:28  without (i-26)  'Apart from,' having nothing more to do with it. The first  time He bore our sins, and was made sin (being sinless); but  now, having put sins wholly away for them who look for Him, and  having made them partakers of the whole fruit of his sacrifice  to put sin away, He appears to them without having to say, or  need to have anything to say, to it. It is gone, as regards  them, by his first coming.>

They stood daily; he is set down  'for a continuance.' Connecting 'in perpetuity' with sacrifice  spoils the whole force of the passage.>

<10:38 10:38  just (d-3)  Or possibly this may read 'my just [man].' i.e. God's just  one, the one he owns as such. There is good authority for it.  The sense runs well and is the same.
  he (e-10)  Or 'any one.' The apostle is contrasting two characters; the  one who perishes, and the one who saves, preserves, his life  (spiritually, of course). The professing Hebrews were in danger  of drawing back. It is certain that in what the apostle  quotes (Hab. 2.3,4) there is no reference in the word 'he' to  the just who lives by faith. The Hebrew and the LXX prove this.  All through this Epistle the Hebrews who acknowledged Jesus as  Messiah are treated as a people; that is, the whole people  accepted on condition of believing. So Peter. 'but are now the  people of God.' And here. 'Jesus, that he might sanctify the  people with his own blood.' In this Epistle there is nothing of  the sanctification of the Spirit; but the writer urges as a  practical truth 'the just shall live by faith.' and then he  says, 'and, if he draw back;' that is, any one holding this  position of a professed believer; but if he was living by faith  in him, he was not drawing back. In a word, drawing back is  one character, living by faith another.>

<11:4 11:4  yet (a-33)  He alludes. I judge, to the voice which called to God from  the ground (Gen. 4.10), but supposes the voice still heard as  witnessing to Abel's faith.>

  earth. (e-31)  Or 'land.'>
<11:17 11:17  himself (f-15)  The Greek implies the will or action of the person receiving.  It is used only here and in Acts 28.7. Publius received,  'took,' Paul and his company into his house. It has the sense  of taking on oneself physically, or as a debt or  responsibility. Abraham's own mind had taken up and  appropriated the promises, and yet he gave up Isaac. It was not  merely they were given and taken away, with which he had  nothing to do; but he had adopted them by faith in his heart,  and trusted God enough to give them up according to flesh.>
<11:18 11:18  said, (g-7)  See Gen. 21.12.>
<11:19 11:19  received (h-17)  The force of the Greek, thus applied, is to get back what one  had, or what belonged to one, when it might have seemed lost  for ever, as Matt. 25.27. The sense I think quite certain in  its application to Isaac's sacrifice. The aorist is constantly  used in this chapter historically.>

<11:22 11:22  dying (b-5)  Lit. 'ending life.'>
<11:25 11:25  choosing (c-1)  These are aorists, but in English the present participle is  joined to the perfect tense as characterizing the action. 'He  refused ... choosing;' 'he refused ... having chosen' would  make a different time of it, not the same. In Greek all is  referred to the time of speaking.>
<11:26 11:26  esteeming (c-1)  These are aorists, but in English the present participle is  joined to the perfect tense as characterizing the action. 'He  refused ... choosing;' 'he refused ... having chosen' would  make a different time of it, not the same. In Greek all is  referred to the time of speaking.>
<11:27 11:27  fearing (c-7)  These are aorists, but in English the present participle is  joined to the perfect tense as characterizing the action. 'He  refused ... choosing;' 'he refused ... having chosen' would  make a different time of it, not the same. In Greek all is  referred to the time of speaking.>
<11:28 11:28  celebrated (d-4)  Here and ver. 17, as to the offering up Isaac, the verbs are  in the perfect; this is remarkable. The other facts are  generally passing facts, part of the whole history; these are  of standing significance, either figuratively setting the  believer on a new ground, or viewed as continued till the time  of the epistle. 'by faith Abraham has offered,' 'by faith he  has celebrated;' only this is not possible in English. It was  not external continuance, for the blood sprinkling was only  once.>

Of men we might say  'unaffectedly,' 'with a readiness of heart which does not make  a great matter of it.' the want is there, and the heart answers  without a second thought.

<1:8 1:8  man, (a-5)  'Double-minded man' is an apposition, not with 'that man,'  but with 'he that doubts' (ver. 6); and ver. 7 is practically a  parenthesis.

<5:7 5:7  patience, (e-2)  Aorist. see Note a.
  patience (f-22)  Two Greek words are translated 'patience' in the New  Testament. In vers. 7 and 8 the verb makrothumeo, and in ver.  10 the noun makrothumia, as Heb. 6.12. In Rom. 2.4; 2Tim.  4.2; 1Pet. 3.20, this reads 'longsuffering' in this  translation. In ver. 11 and elsewhere 'endurance' is  hupomone, also translated 'patience' at times, according to  the context. In general, makrothumia expresses patience in  respect of persons, but hupomone in respect of things. The  man who is 'longsuffering' (makrothumia) does not suffer  himself easily to be provoked by injurious persons, or to be  angered, 2Tim. 4.2. The man who is 'patient' (hupomone),  though under great trials, bears up, and does not lose heart or  courage, Rom. 5.3; 2Cor. 1.6.>

<5:16 5:16  your (c-3)  Lit. 'the.'
  fervent (d-19)  Or, 'operative,' 'working effectually,' if the word be taken  as a participle, as elsewhere in the New Testament. The A.V.  combines the two ideas, 'the effectual fervent prayer,' but it  is hardly both. I do not think it is inwrought by spiritual  power. It is the person who is 'fervent.'>

We could say  'present in spirit,' 'fervent in spirit,' because it is  characteristic. but 'made alive in spirit' conveys to the  English mind the idea of an accomplished fact. It cannot be  simply characteristic. In Greek, on the other hand, although  conveying a fact, it has a characteristic significance. The  sense given here is right.>

<3:21 3:21  demand (n-20)  Or 'engagement,' or 'testimony.' The Greek word here  translated 'demand' is a very difficult one, and has puzzled  all critics and commentators. It means 'a question.' All the  commentators speak of its use as a legal term with the sense of  contract, or rather stipulations or obligations of a contract.  I judge (as usual in these forms) that it refers to the  question asked rather than to the asking of the question. The  legal use arises from a questioning which settled the terms of  the contract, hence called the questioning. I am disposed to  think it is the thing demanded. It requires as before God, and  has it in baptism as a figure by the resurrection of Jesus  Christ. It must be remembered that 'of a good conscience' in  English may be the thing requested or 'he who requests.' The  form of the word in the Greek would rather make it the thing  requested or demanded.>

<5:3 5:3  your (a-6)  Lit. 'the possessions.' What they are is wholly beside the  mark. No doubt the saints were in his thoughts; but the  character of the elders' conduct is what is in question. If  there were no article, it would mean 'not like persons who lord  it over possessions.' but here it is more definite. Do not be  as persons lording it over your possessions, viewing the saints  as something belonging to you. 'Possessions' is not the name of  the flock, but the flock was not to be treated as the  'possessions' of the elders.>

Now this is not gathered by a  human interpretation of an isolated passage which has its own  meaning and its own solution, as if a man uttered it; for it is  a part of God's mind, uttered as holy men were moved by the  Holy Spirit to utter it. In the 'prophecy of scripture' the  apostle has in mind the thing prophesied, without losing the  idea of the passage. Hence I have ventured to say '[the scope  of] no prophecy.' One might almost say 'no prophecy explains  itself.'>

Though a little harsh in these cases in  English, 'the' ought to be retained, because it is not simply a  state -- a man being in darkness; but a specific darkness, the  ignorance and non-revelation of God is spoken of. only it is  abstract, and so absolute. 'The darkness' is the natural  condition of sinful man without God, who is light; the creature  without God. Hence in John 1.5 'the light appears in darkness,  and the darkness apprehended it not.' 'Is passing' (ver. 8) is  abstract. 'The true light shines.' that is absolute; it shines,  whether seen or not. But though some had received the light, he  could not say the darkness was all gone, for it was not, but  only with some who 'were once darkness, but now light in the  Lord.' Thus it was not as in the gospel, when Christ was upon  earth; for then the darkness apprehended not the light shining  in darkness. It was putting the light out. As long as he was in  the world, he was the light of the world. Now it was not so.  there was a passing away of the darkness.>

  hour, (a-7)  John uses 'hour' continually in the sense of 'time,' as John  5.35, 'a season.' It is properly a given point of time. With  John it is constantly a period characterized by one thing, and  hence looked at as only one time. As we say 'the hour of  Napoleon's greatness.'
  come (b-21)  'There have come' (ginomai. John 1.17) is not from the same  word as 'comes' in this verse. It is what did not exist before,  but begins or becomes. 'There have come' I believe nearest the  sense. The perfect tense conveys the thought that they still  exist.>

The Greek reads 'sin is  lawlessness,' that is, the absence of the principle of law  (not the law), or, in other words, of the control of God over  the soul. I ought to have no will of my own, but be in  obedience. The statement is reciprocal, and may be read  'lawlessness is sin.'>

I will not say there is no  allusion to the future awaited exercise of divine power; for in  Daniel, not only is the Son of man brought before the Ancient  of days, but the Ancient of days comes. In the words 'who is,  and was, and is to come,' there is surely reference to the  abiding nature of his being. 'Who is to come' seems to me thus  to render more truly the sense than any other form of words.  The Greek has the future sense. See Mark 10.30, Luke 18.30; and  Mark 11.10 partly runs into this sense. 'The coming one' became  a name of the expected Messiah, as in Matt. 11.3, and in Heb.  10.37.

In the words 'who is,  and was, and is to come,' there is surely reference to the  abiding nature of his being. 'Who is to come' seems to me thus  to render more truly the sense than any other form of words.  The Greek has the future sense. See Mark 10.30, Luke 18.30; and  Mark 11.10 partly runs into this sense. 'The coming one' became  a name of the expected Messiah, as in Matt. 11.3, and in Heb.  10.37. But note, 'essential being' is put first, 'who is;' and  then 'time past, and to come.' 'Who is' asserts the essential  nature of his being.
  Omega, (k-7)  Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek  alphabet.
  God, (l-11)  'Jehovah Elohim,' as Luke 1.32; see chs. 4.8; 15.3; 18.8; 21.22; 22.5,6.
  Almighty. (m-24)  'The Almighty' always has the article in Greek in the  Revelation.>
<1:9 1:9  patience, (n-13)  Hupomone, 'endurance.' see Jas. 5.7; so chs. 2.2,3,19;  13.10; 14.12. The words 'tribulation,' 'kingdom,' 'patience'  are intimately connected, being brought together under one head  by one article in the Greek.
  was (o-16)  Ginomai. see John 1.17. His being there was an event which  happened on account of the word of God. So 'became,' ver. 10.>
<1:10 1:10  Spirit (p-5)  'In [the] Spirit' is a state into which he entered. See  Note c, Matt. 3.11.
  day, (a-9)  The 'dominical' or 'lordly' day -- characterized by belonging  to the Lord, as 'Lord's,' 1Cor. 11.20.>
<1:11 1:11  write (b-5)  send (b-10)
  Aorist, 'have it written and sent.' it is to be a complete  thing done.>
<1:12 1:12  lamps, (c-20)  Or 'lampstands' (luchnia) but simply here, I think, 'lamps'  as compared with Heb. 9.2, where it is clearly the  'candlestick' or 'lampstand.' If luchnos and luchnia are  distinguished, luchnia is the stand. The words are so  distinguished in Matt. 5.15, Luke 8.16; 11.33.>
<1:13 1:13  [the] (d-11)  Or 'a Son of man.' See Dan. 7.13, also without the article.  It is not likeness to a person John knew, but to the character  known by this title in scripture. To have seen angels in heaven  would have been no wonder, but to see one as 'Son of man' was.  This chapter corresponds to Dan. 7. only now he was seen on  earth. It was the title the Lord habitually took. This made it  personal; but in Daniel, though surely the same person, it was  characteristic. Here, too, it is characteristic. Still the  person designated is now known, and it is difficult to say 'a  Son of man,' because of excluding this. 'Son-of-man-like' is  feeble, it might only mean a manner. see ch. 14.14.>
<1:15 1:15  fine (e-5)  Or 'shining.'>
<1:18 1:18  became (f-7)  Ginomai. see John 1.17. Became what he was not before.

<2:11 2:11  wise (c-22)  A strong negative.>
<2:18 2:18  fine (d-33)  Or 'shining.'>
<2:20 2:20  woman (e-10)  Some read 'thy wife,' alluding doubtless to Jezebel's  connexion with responsible Ahab. And that is the meaning I  believe of 'angel;' the symbolical representative of the  assembly seen in those responsible in it, which indeed all  really are. Hence 'thee,' and 'to you,' 'to you each,' and 'the  rest.'
  servants (f-24)  Or 'bondmen,' as ch. 1.1.>

  known (b-22)  See Note, ver. 23.>
<3:2 3:2   (c-1)  Ginomai. Lit. 'become so.'
  are (d-10)  The imperfect tense. I translate 'are,' because 'were'  supposes they are no longer 'about to die,' which is contrary  to the passage. Perhaps 'have been' may be used. It refers to  what they were found to be when he strengthened them. The point  of departure of thought is not the writer's when writing, but  the strengthener's when strengthening.>

<3:9 3:9  know (e-38)  See Note, ch. 2.23.
  make (g-3)  Lit. 'give' or 'have given' (ver. 8) and 'give' (ver. 9).
  homage (h-32)  Proskuneo, see Matt. 4.10. This is the word translated 'do  homage' or 'worship' throughout Revelation.>

<3:20 3:20  stand (d-3)  Meaning 'I have placed myself there and am standing.' see  John 1.26.>
<4:3 4:3  round (e-20)  I use 'round' for what is connected with anything (not  necessarily united to it) as a centre, as the tire of a wheel,  but 'around' is used for detached objects encircling.>
<4:4 4:4  round (e-2)  I use 'round' for what is connected with anything (not  necessarily united to it) as a centre, as the tire of a wheel,  but 'around' is used for detached objects encircling.>
<4:5 4:5  lamps (f-15)  Lampas. only here and ch. 8.10 where the word is translated  'torch.' Not the lamp as a utensil (luchnia, ch. 1.13), but  what furnished the light itself>
<4:6 4:6  around (e-19)  I use 'round' for what is connected with anything (not  necessarily united to it) as a centre, as the tire of a wheel,  but 'around' is used for detached objects encircling.>
<4:8 4:8  creatures, (a-5)  See Isa. 6.2,3.
  round (b-14)  I judge that Ezek. 10.12 shows that 'round' belongs to the  eyes.
  not (c-25)  I prefer 'cease not' to 'have no rest,' because in English  'having no rest' means constant fatigue. The Greek here means  'no intermission of action.'

<5:9 5:9  redeemed (k-27)  Or 'bought,' as ch. 14.3,4.>

In men it means piety and  uprightness. Chesed is so translated in the Old Testament. It  is in general the sum of qualities which suit and form the  divine character in man, as opposed to the human will. what God  gives as consistent with himself, his character, and promise.  The 'sure mercies' of David is expressed by this word in the  LXX, Isa. 55.3; Acts 13.34. God alone possesses the qualities  which entitle him to worship as a pious man would understand  it. Hosios is used in this general way for 'holy.' see Note  i, Heb. 7.26.

But I apprehend 'it'  (ver. 3) and 'they' (ver. 4) are the sense, in spite of  accuracy of grammar. blood took place as a consequence in what  is spoken of. The sense is more striking as it stands in Greek  considered as a vision. What he saw took that character.
