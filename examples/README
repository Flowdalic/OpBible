This directory includes examples of six variants of the book Daniel in
English language and other six variants of the same book in Czech.

You can try to generate them. You have to copy the macros to a directory
where LuaTeX is able to find them and then you can run the script ./make-all
from this directory. All 12 variants will be generated and, moreover, the
opbible-texdoc is generated to this directory.

To be more accurrate: If you are running TeXlive on a Unix system, then you can do

cd opbible/examples
mkdir -p ~/texmf/tex/opbible
cp ../macros/* ~/texmf/tex/opbible/
./make-all

These commands generate 6 variants in english/ directory, 6 variants in czech/ 
directory and opbible-techdoc.pdf in the examples/ directory.

If you have not a commercial font Biblon installed, then the generated examples 
use Termes font family instead Biblon.
